    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "rebuttal": "OPPOSITION REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nCLASH POINT 1: Democratic Governance Stability\nOriginal Claim: Voter-triggered recall elections are necessary for democratic accountability\n\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\n\nChallenge:\nThe proposition fundamentally misunderstands democratic governance by conflating accountability with constant electoral uncertainty. While accountability is crucial, true democratic representation requires giving elected officials sufficient time to implement their mandated agenda. The proposed mechanism:\n- Transforms governance into a perpetual popularity contest\n- Prevents meaningful long-term policy development\n- Creates an environment of constant political vulnerability\n- Undermines the core principle of electoral mandates\n\nThe 90-day recall window creates a systemic vulnerability where governors spend more time defending their position than governing effectively. This isn't enhanced accountability; it's democratic dysfunction.\n\nImpact: Demonstrates that the proposed mechanism fundamentally damages the strategic capacity of state-level executive leadership.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Signature Threshold Vulnerability\nOriginal Claim: 20% signature threshold represents meaningful democratic input\n\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\n\nChallenge:\nThe 20% threshold is critically flawed as a democratic mechanism:\n- Represents a minority, not majority sentiment\n- Allows disproportionate influence by well-organized special interest groups\n- Creates an asymmetric power dynamic that privileges mobilized minorities over broader electoral will\n- Historical precedents (Wisconsin, California recalls) show these mechanisms are often hijacked by partisan extremes, not genuine accountability\n\nComparative Analysis:\n- Standard election requires 50%+ support\n- Impeachment requires substantive misconduct\n- This proposal allows removal with significantly lower bars of justification\n\nThe threshold fundamentally inverts democratic principles by allowing a small, potentially unrepresentative group to challenge a democratically elected mandate.\n\nImpact: Exposes the procedural weakness of the proposed recall mechanism as fundamentally anti-democratic.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Institutional Governance Continuity\nOriginal Claim: Recall mechanisms enhance governmental accountability\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\n\nChallenge:\nEffective governance requires predictability and consistent leadership. The proposed mechanism:\n- Introduces constant administrative uncertainty\n- Prevents long-term strategic planning\n- Creates a reactive political environment\n- Undermines institutional knowledge and policy continuity\n\nAlternative Principle: Genuine accountability should be achieved through:\n- Robust existing impeachment processes\n- Regular elections\n- Transparent governmental mechanisms\n- Comprehensive oversight systems\n\nThe recall proposal replaces substantive accountability with performative political volatility.\n\nImpact: Demonstrates that the mechanism damages institutional effectiveness more than it enhances democratic accountability.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Potential counterarguments about executive accountability\n- Claims about democratic responsiveness\n- Concerns about protecting against genuinely problematic governors\n\nAdditional Support:\n- Existing constitutional mechanisms already provide accountability\n- Regular election cycles serve as natural accountability check\n- Impeachment processes protect against serious misconduct\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- More comprehensive understanding of democratic governance\n- Better appreciation of institutional stability requirements\n- Stronger principled argument about representative democracy\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n1.

      "thoughts": "This debate is fundamentally symmetrical given we're identical models. However, the rebuttal effectively dismantles the opposition's key arguments by:\n1. Reframing stability as a positive democratic feature\n2. Demonstrating robust threshold design\n3. Challenging core assumptions about representation\n\nThe arguments are precise, evidence-driven, and strategically constructed to address potential weaknesses. While a 50% baseline probability exists, the comprehensive rebuttal suggests a slight argumentative advantage."

      "thoughts": "Analysis of debate suggests a very tight argument, but our principled critique of the recall mechanism provides slightly stronger philosophical grounding. The evidence critique of the 20% threshold and the argument about institutional disruption seem particularly compelling. However, given we're debating an identical model, true victory margin is razor-thin.\n\nConfidence is high, but not absolute. The arguments are structurally sound but could be interpreted multiple ways by a judge."

I assess my probability of winning at slightly above 50% - perhaps 55-60% - due to our proactive reframing of democratic accountability principles.\n\nRationale for slight confidence: Our arguments provide a more nuanced, forward-looking perspective on democratic mechanisms."
