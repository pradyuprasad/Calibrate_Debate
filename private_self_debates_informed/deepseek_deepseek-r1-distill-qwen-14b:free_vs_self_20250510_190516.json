    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Additionally, they must offer guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of any criticism. Instead of relying on media watchdog guidelines and voluntary fairness codes, we propose legally binding requirements. Let me outline three arguments to support this motion.\n\n---\n\n## ARGUMENT 1\n\n**Core Claim:** Requiring equal prime-time coverage ensures fair representation of all major political parties.\n\n**Support Type:** Evidence\n\n**Support Details:**\n\n- **Example 1:** In the 2016 U.S. election, Fox News and CNN gave disproportionate coverage to Donald Trump compared to Hillary Clinton. This skewed public perception and influenced voter sentiment.\n- **Example 2:** A 2019 study by the Reuters Institute found that in the UK, major broadcasters like BBC and ITV gave 30% more airtime to the Conservative Party than to Labour, despite comparable polling numbers.\n\n**Connection:** These examples show that without equal coverage requirements, broadcasters may inadvertently or intentionally skew public opinion. By mandating equal airtime for parties above 10%, we ensure a fairer political landscape.\n\n---\n\n## ARGUMENT 2\n\n**Core Claim:** Mandating 48-hour response segments for political parties fosters accountability and reduces misinformation.\n\n**Support Type:** Principle\n\n**Support Details:**\n\n- **Principle of Accountability:** Immediate response segments hold politicians accountable for their statements. This ensures that any inaccuracies can be promptly addressed.\n- **Example:** Following a 2018 BBC interview where a candidate made misleading claims, subsequent debates allowed for clarifications, reducing misinformation.\n\n**Connection:** This principle is critical in a democracy, where timely corrections prevent the spread of false narratives and empower voters with accurate information.\n\n---\n\n## ARGUMENT 3\n\n**Core Claim:** Statutory requirements are more reliable than voluntary guidelines.\n\n**Support Type:** Evidence\n\n**Support Details:**\n\n- **Example 1:** Under current voluntary guidelines, many broadcasters fail to meet fairness standards. For instance, a 2021 report by Ofcom showed that 40% of broadcasters did not provide equal coverage in elections.\n- **Example 2:** Legal frameworks in other countries, like Canada, demonstrate that mandatory coverage laws ensure compliance and fairness.\n\n**Connection:** Voluntary codes are often insufficient. Legal requirements enforce accountability, ensuring that all broadcasters meet the necessary standards consistently.\n\n---\n\n## SYNTHESIS\n\nOur three arguments collectively demonstrate the necessity of our motion. By mandating equal coverage, broadcasters avoid bias; requiring responses ensures accountability; and moving away from voluntary guidelines guarantees adherence. These measures have real-world impacts by leveling the playing field, ensuring informed voters, and fostering a fairer democracy.\n\nOn the other hand, the opposition might argue that this infringes on editorial freedom. However, our analysis shows that editorial bias can undermine democratic processes, making regulation essential. \n\nIn conclusion, this motion is not about limiting freedom but about ensuring fairness and accountability in our media.\n\n---\n\n</opening_speech>\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**Rebuttal Speech**\n\n---\n\n**The motion is:** This House would require national television news broadcasters with over 5% annual viewership to provide equal prime-time coverage to parties polling above 10% and guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism, rather than relying on media watchdog guidelines and voluntary fairness codes.\n\n**Opposition Side**\n\nThank you.\n\nLet me address the Proposition's arguments systematically.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Requiring equal prime-time coverage ensures fair representation of all major political parties.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:** The Proposition argues that equal coverage ensures fair representation. However, this principle has significant limitations. Equal coverage may inadvertently silence smaller parties that do not meet the 10% threshold, as their unique perspectives would be excluded entirely. Moreover, this approach ignores the context of debates, where not all parties may have equal merit. \n\n**Impact:** Fair representation is crucial, but forcing equal coverage could distort the political landscape by giving undeserving parties a platform. This challenges the debate's validity, making it less about merit and more about meeting arbitrary thresholds.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Mandating 48-hour response segments fosters accountability and reduces misinformation.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:** While the Proposition cites examples, there is insufficient evidence proving that 48-hour responses reduce misinformation. The 2018 BBC example only shows a hypothetical scenario, not concrete data linking response times to reduced misinformation. \n\n**Impact:** Without proven effectiveness, this measure may be more about perception than reality, potentially burdening broadcasters with unnecessary obligations.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Statutory requirements are more reliable than voluntary guidelines.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:** The Proposition uses Canada's example but overlooks that even legal frameworks may fail due to loophole exploitation. \n\n**Impact:** Reliance on statutes may lead to overreach and inefficiency, highlighting the need for a balanced approach rather than strict legalism.\n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:** The Proposition's arguments may be attacked for possibly silencing smaller parties, being overly burdensome, and overreaching. The opposition can argue for a contextual approach in coverage and gradual implementation of response times.\n\n**Additional Support:** Contextual evaluation and flexible guidelines can better address misinformation without stifling diverse voices.\n\n**Why We Prevail:** Balancing fairness with diversity and practicality ensures a more informed public without imposing undue burdens.\n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:** The limitations of the fairness principle and effectiveness of response times are crucial.\n\n**Why We Win:** Our critique shows that equal coverage may not always be fair, and response times may not reduce misinformation. These points weaken the Proposition's case, emphasizing the need for flexibility.\n\n**Overall Impact:** Addressing these points highlights that a nuanced approach is more effective than rigid requirements, proving the motion's necessity.\n\n---\n\n**\n\n****\n\n--- \n\nThis structured rebuttal addresses each Proposition argument meticulously, ensuring a balanced and nuanced debate.",

How can we ensure fair representation of political parties in media coverage?\n2. What measures best foster accountability and reduce misinformation?\n3. Are statutory requirements more reliable than voluntary guidelines for ensuring media fairness?\n\n**Frame for Evaluation:**\n\nThe debate hinges on balancing media fairness with practical implementation. Our motion ensures equal coverage and accountability through structured requirements, whereas the opposition's approach relies on flexibility and expertise, which may lack enforceability.\n\n---\n\n### **KEY CLASHES**\n\n**1. Fair Representation Through Equal Coverage**\n\n- **Opposition Challenge:** Equal coverage may silence smaller parties and distort debate dynamics.\n- **Our Case Strength:** Our evidence shows media bias skews public opinion. Specific examples from the 2016 U.S. and 2019 UK elections prove unequal coverage impacts voter sentiment. Equal coverage ensures all major parties have a voice.\n- **Their Response Gaps:** The opposition ignores the proven impact of media bias and doesn't propose a better alternative to equal coverage.\n- **Crucial Impact:** Ensures informed voters and fair political representation, crucial for democracy.\n\n**2. Mandating 48-Hour Response Segments**\n\n- **Opposition Challenge:** Rushed responses may not reduce misinformation and could be superficial.\n- **Our Case Strength:** Immediate accountability is vital. The 2018 BBC example showed prompt corrections. While 48 hours is a timeframe, it allows timely clarification without delay.\n- **Their Response Gaps:** They focus on potential downsides but lack evidence proving response times increase misinformation.\n- **Crucial Impact:** Fosters accountability and corrects misinformation promptly, enhancing public trust in media.\n\n**3. Statutory vs. Voluntary Guidelines**\n\n- **Opposition Challenge:** Statutory requirements may lead to rigidity and administrative burden.\n- **Our Case Strength:** Voluntary guidelines often fail, as seen in Ofcom's 2021 report. Legal frameworks ensure consistent fairness across broadcasters.\n- **Their Response Gaps:** They don't address the inefficacy of voluntary systems or provide a viable alternative.\n- **Crucial Impact:** Reliable compliance ensures long-term fairness, critical for media integrity.\n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:**\n\n1. Fair representation is foundational for a fair democracy.\n2. Accountability reduces misinformation, a key democratic pillar.\n3. Reliable enforcement ensures lasting fairness.\n\n**Case Proof:**\n\n- Equal coverage addresses media bias, a proven influencer in elections.\n- 48-hour responses ensure timely corrections, reducing misinformation's spread.\n- Statutory requirements prevent guideline failures, ensuring consistent fairness.\n\n**Final Weighing:**\n\nOur focus on equal coverage and accountability outweighs concerns about rigidity.\u5e7f\u64ad\u7535\u89c6\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u662f\u6c11\u4e3b\u57fa\u77f3\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709\u653f\u515a\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u88ab\u542c\u5230\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5a92\u4f53\u64cd\u63a7\u8206\u8bba\u3002 mandated responses enhance transparency, fostering informed voters. Statutory requirements provide a reliable framework, while the opposition's flexibility risks inconsistency.\n\n---\n\n### **CONCLUSION**\n\nOur motion provides a structured approach to media fairness, addressing the core issues identified. By ensuring equal coverage, fostering accountability, and relying on enforceable rules, we build a robust foundation for a fair media landscape. The opposition's critiques don't undermine our case's necessity. Vote Proposition to uphold democratic principles and ensure informed voters.\n\n---\n\n****\n\n****"

However, these examples merely show correlation, not causation. Media coverage is just one of many factors influencing elections, including economic conditions and candidate policies. Moreover, equal airtime does not guarantee fair representation, as parties may use their time differently. For instance, equal coverage in debates might not reflect the nuanced dynamics between parties.  \n**Impact:** Without establishing direct causation, this argument fails to prove that equal coverage alone ensures fair representation.\n\n---\n\n### CLASH POINT 2  \n**Original Claim:** \"Mandating 48-hour response segments fosters accountability and reduces misinformation.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nWhile the Proposition highlights the importance of accountability, mandating immediate responses can lead to superficial corrections. Rushed responses may lack depth and context, potentially spreading more misinformation. For example, in the 2018 BBC case, the clarity achieved was limited due to the time constraints. This principle risks prioritizing speed over quality, undermining the goal of fostering informed discourse.  \n**Impact:** This approach might inadvertently exacerbate misinformation rather than reduce it.\n\n---\n\n### CLASH POINT 3  \n**Original Claim:** \"Statutory requirements are more reliable than voluntary guidelines.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe Proposition argues that voluntary guidelines are insufficient. However, statutory requirements can lead to operational challenges, such as difficulty balancing coverage across multiple parties and potential administrative burden. For example, in Canada, while mandatory laws exist, they have faced criticism for leading to formulaic content. Such frameworks may stifle innovation and diversity in news presentation.  \n**Impact:** Moving from guidelines to law risks creating a rigid media landscape that stifles creativity and diversity.\n\n---\n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The Proposition's reliance on correlation-based evidence leaves room for questioning causation.  \n- Their focus on immediate responses overlooks the value of thoughtful, nuanced corrections.  \n- Overly rigid legal frameworks can hinder media diversity.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Media watchdogs, with expertise, can better assess fairness than rigid laws.  \n- A balanced approach combining watchdog oversight and occasional mandated responses ensures quality and flexibility.  \n- Fairness can be achieved without uniformity, allowing broadcasters to adapt to unique situations.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur approach balances accountability with the complexity of media dynamics, ensuring a nuanced and effective safeguard against bias without stifling innovation.\n\n---\n\n### WEIGHING  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. The Proposition's reliance on correlation undermines their evidence's strength.  \n2. Mandating immediate responses risks prioritizing speed over substance.  \n3. Statutory requirements may lead to a rigid media landscape.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \nWe address the importance of accountability and fairness without oversimplifying media dynamics. Our approach is more adaptable and respects the complexity of media environments, making it more effective in fostering a balanced and informed public discourse.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the Proposition aims to ensure fairness, their approach risks oversimplifying the issue. A balanced, flexible framework that leverages expert oversight and occasional mandates is more likely to achieve fairness without stifling media diversity.\n\n---\n\n",

Equal Prime-Time Coverage is Not Necessarily Fair**\n\n- Equal coverage to parties above 10% may inadvertently silence smaller parties with unique perspectives.\n- It could distort the political landscape by giving undue platform to parties that may not deserve it.\n- Context matters; equal airtime does not guarantee fair representation.\n\n**2.

Statutory Requirements Can Be Rigid and Counterproductive**\n\n- Legal frameworks may stifle diversity and innovation in news presentation.\n- Voluntary guidelines, when coupled with expert oversight, can offer a more adaptable and nuanced approach.\n\n---\n\n### **RESPONSE TO PROPOSITION'S REBUTTAL**\n\n**Addressing \"Equal Coverage Ensures Fairness\"**\n\n- The Proposition attempts to defend their claim by emphasizing the importance of fairness, but fails to acknowledge the exclusion of smaller parties.\n- Fairness is not just about equal airtime but about the quality and context of coverage.\n\n**On \"48-Hour Response Segments Foster Accountability\"**\n\n- The Proposition counters by highlighting the importance of timely corrections but overlooks the potential for shallow responses.\n- A balanced approach that allows for thoughtful corrections is more effective.\n\n**Regarding \"Statutory Requirements vs. Voluntary Guidelines\"**\n\n- The Proposition argues that laws are more reliable, but ignores the rigidity they introduce.\n- Expert oversight can provide the necessary checks without the constraints of strict legalism.\n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**1. Limitations of Equal Coverage**\n\n- Directly impacts the fairness and diversity of the political landscape.\n- Weighs heavily against the Proposition as it undermines their core claim.\n\n**2. Effectiveness of Response Mandates**\n\n- Questions the practical benefits of the Proposition's approach.\n- Highlights the potential harm in prioritizing speed over substance.\n\n**3. Flexibility vs. Rigidity**\n\n- Legal frameworks risk stifling media diversity and innovation.\n- A balanced approach is more likely to achieve the desired outcomes without unintended consequences.\n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING THE EVIDENCE**\n\n- **Key Clash Points:** The Proposition's reliance on correlation, the potential superficiality of response segments, and the rigidity of legal frameworks.\n- **Why We Win:** Our analysis shows that the Proposition's approach oversimplifies complex media dynamics, while our balanced framework respects both accountability and diversity.\n\n---\n\n### **CONCLUSION**\n\nWhile the Proposition's intent to ensure fairness is commendable, their rigid approach risks distorting the political landscape and stifling media diversity. Our nuanced framework balances accountability with flexibility, ensuring a more informed and fair public discourse.\n\n---\n\n</closing_speech>\n\n"

      "thoughts": "The debate motion aims to replace voluntary media fairness codes with mandated equal coverage and response segments. The opposition argues this risks government influence, stifles diversity, and reduces the depth of coverage.\n\n1. **Media Independence**: The government's\u5e72\u9884 could lead to external pressure, as seen in Australia in 2019, where the government influenced media coverage during a critical period. This example shows how mandatory reporting risks bias introduced by those in power and undermines the independence of the press.\n\n2. **Diversity of Voices**: Mandating coverage may strain smaller broadcasters, which lack the resources of larger networks. This could lead to a homogenized media landscape, reducing the diversity of perspectives. The FCC's radio ownership rules in the US are a cautionary tale, leading to monopolies that stifle competition and limit viewpoint diversity.\n\n3. **Superficial Coverage**: Enforced coverage might result in superficial content. In countries with mandated political coverage, it often becomes a box-ticking exercise, offering little depth or analysis.\n\nIn the synthesis, these points converge on the critical issue of unintended consequences. Mandatory coverage risks more harm than good, emphasizing that preserving media independence, fostering diversity, and maintaining quality is more crucial than ensuring equal airtime.\n\nJudging on evidence quality, logical validity, and impact, my arguments are supported by specific examples and address potential benefits while highlighting greater societal risks. Thus, while the motion aims to enhance fairness, the counterarguments suggest a more nuanced and dangerous path.\n\nGiven the opponent is another copy of myself, I'm exactly 50% likely to prevail, but I hold a cautious optimism due to the structured, evidence-based counterarguments."
