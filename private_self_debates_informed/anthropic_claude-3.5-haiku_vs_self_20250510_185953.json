    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Our proposal doesn't eliminate editorial discretion but establishes a baseline of fairness. Just as we have regulations preventing monopolies or requiring equal time in political advertising, this proposal creates a structural guardrail for democratic communication.\n\nKey Counterarguments:\n- Editorial independence doesn't mean unrestricted bias\n- Professional judgment can still exist within regulated frameworks\n- Current media landscape demonstrates systemic bias that requires intervention\n\nImpact: Proves that regulated fairness enhances, rather than restricts, journalistic integrity\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Perverse Incentives\nOriginal Claim: \"Small parties could exploit requirements to gain disproportionate media exposure\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\n\nChallenge:\n- The 10% polling threshold prevents fringe exploitation\n- Existing media ecosystems already disproportionately amplify dominant narratives\n- Concrete polling requirements create objective, measurable criteria\n- Evidence from Germany shows regulated media access increases, not undermines, discourse quality\n\nComparative Analysis:\nCurrent System: Unregulated amplification of powerful interests\nProposed System: Structured, threshold-based representation\n\nImpact: Demonstrates that regulated access creates more representative discourse, not artificial amplification\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Implementation Complexity\nOriginal Claim: \"Policy would be logistically complex and potentially unconstitutional\"\n\nChallenge Type: Principle and Evidence Critique\n\nChallenge:\n- Constitutional precedents exist for media fairness regulations\n- Technological infrastructure makes tracking/implementing coverage easier than ever\n- Administrative costs are minimal compared to democratic benefits\n- First Amendment protects against compelled speech, but not against ensuring fair public discourse\n\nSpecific Counterpoints:\n- Existing political advertising regulations provide implementation models\n- Digital tracking makes compliance measurement straightforward\n- Benefits of increased democratic transparency outweigh administrative challenges\n\nImpact: Shows implementation is feasible and constitutionally sound\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Potential administrative overhead\n- Potential resistance from media organizations\n- Complex measurement of \"equal coverage\"\n\nReinforcing Support:\n- Clear, measurable polling thresholds\n- Technological infrastructure for tracking\n- Precedents in other democratic systems\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Principled approach to democratic communication\n- Structured, objective implementation\n- Focus on systemic improvement, not individual media control\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n1.

Through three robust arguments, we've proven that structured media representation creates a more transparent, accountable, and inclusive political discourse.\n\nKEY CLASH RESOLUTION\n\n1. Media Independence Argument\n- Opponents claim regulation undermines editorial discretion\n- We've proven regulation creates structural fairness, not elimination of professional judgment\n- 10% polling threshold ensures objective, measurable representation\n- Precedents exist in political advertising and broadcast regulations\n\nDecisive Point: Fairness mechanisms enhance, not restrict, media's democratic function\n\n2. Perverse Incentives Challenge\n- Opposition fears fringe amplification\n- Our proposal's strict polling thresholds prevent unwarranted exposure\n- Evidence from Germany shows regulated access improves discourse quality\n- Current unregulated system already disproportionately amplifies powerful interests\n\nDecisive Point: Structured access prevents, not enables, systemic manipulation\n\n3. Implementation Feasibility\n- Technological infrastructure makes tracking straightforward\n- Constitutional precedents support fairness regulations\n- Administrative costs minimal compared to democratic benefits\n- Digital tracking enables precise, efficient compliance measurement\n\nDecisive Point: Practical implementation is not only possible but beneficial\n\nCORE PRINCIPLES REINFORCED\n- Democratic transparency\n- Equitable political representation\n- Accountability in media communication\n- Structural mechanisms for fair discourse\n\nWHY WE WIN\n1.

Democratic discourse isn't about forced equal representation, but about substantive, merit-based reporting.\n\nKey Critiques:\n- Artificially mandated coverage doesn't create genuine representation\n- Dilutes journalistic standards of newsworthiness\n- Conflates visibility with meaningful political discourse\n- Ignores qualitative differences between political platforms\n\nCritical Evidence:\n- Research shows that compelled media coverage often backfires, giving undeserved legitimacy to fringe movements\n- Countries with similar mandatory media access laws have experienced increased political fragmentation\n- Viewers are sophisticated consumers who can distinguish between substantial and marginal political narratives\n\nImpact: This point demonstrates that forced representation undermines rather than enhances democratic discourse by removing professional editorial judgment.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Accountability and Transparency Mechanisms\n\nOriginal Claim: \"Mandatory response segments will increase political accountability and reduce misinformation\"\n\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\n\nChallenge:\nThe proposition's evidence is fundamentally flawed, presenting a simplistic view of media accountability.\n\nKey Critiques:\n- 48-hour response windows are arbitrary and can be manipulated\n- Creates reactive rather than proactive information ecosystem\n- Fails to address root causes of misinformation\n- Overlooks complexity of modern media communication\n\nCounter Evidence:\n- Academic studies show that mandated responses often become platforms for further controversy\n- Digital media landscape means information cycles move faster than rigid 48-hour windows\n- More effective accountability comes from media literacy and diverse information sources\n\nImpact: Demonstrates that mechanical response requirements are ineffective against sophisticated media manipulation strategies.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Economic and Structural Media Reform\n\nOriginal Claim: \"Legislating media fairness will improve journalistic standards and audience trust\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\n\nChallenge:\nPropose an alternative principle: Media quality emerges from competitive, free market of ideas, not regulatory enforcement.\n\nCounter Principle:\n- Trust is built through journalistic integrity, not mandatory coverage\n- Economic incentives naturally push towards more comprehensive reporting\n- Viewer choice and market feedback are more powerful quality control mechanisms\n- Regulatory approaches risk creating bureaucratic, checkbox-style reporting\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n- Most trusted media brands globally have achieved reputation through consistent quality\n- Countries with most press freedom correlate with highest media trust\n- Market competition drives innovation and accuracy more effectively than legal mandates\n\nImpact: Shows that organic, market-driven approaches are superior to regulatory interventions in media quality.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\n\nVulnerabilities:\n- Potential accusation of defending status quo\n- Risk of seeming anti-transparency\n- Potential perception of protecting media's existing power structures\n\nAdditional Support:\n- Emphasize commitment to improving media quality\n- Highlight alternative, more nuanced reform approaches\n- Demonstrate understanding of genuine media representation challenges\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- More sophisticated understanding of media ecosystem\n- Respect for journalistic independence\n- Recognition of viewer agency\n- Principled defense of free speech and editorial discretion\n\nWEIGHING\n\nKey Clash Points:\n1.

The win probability feels like a classic 50-50 scenario, with slight edge to our more nuanced approach. Potential swing factors include depth of principle interpretation and judges' receptiveness to market-driven solutions."

However, our strategic framing, principled arguments, and systematic rebuttal suggest a slight edge.\n\nConfidence Factors:\n+ Comprehensive argument structure\n+ Evidence-based reasoning\n+ Clear clash resolution\n- Inherent 50/50 debate symmetry\n\nGiven the identical competence, leaning slightly optimistic but maintaining mathematical neutrality."
