    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "rebuttal": "**Rebuttal Speech**\n\n**The motion is:** This House believes that governments should transition their primary role in space from direct operation to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:** Transitioning to regulation and oversight will increase the efficiency of space operations.  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The examples provided by the opponent, such as NASA's contracts with SpaceX and Blue Origin's New Shepard program, are commendable. However, they fail to establish a direct link between transitioning to regulation and increased efficiency.  \n- While private companies like SpaceX have indeed reduced costs, these achievements occurred under existing government contracts, not solely due to regulation.  \n- Moreover, the data provided does not account for the potential risks of reduced oversight, such as safety issues or monopolistic practices in the private sector.  \n**Impact:** Without a clear causal link, the opponent's evidence does not sufficiently prove that regulation alone is the primary driver of efficiency.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:** The private sector drives innovation more effectively than government direct operations.  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- While private companies like Tesla and Virgin Galactic have made notable innovations, government initiatives are equally responsible for foundational breakthroughs. For example, government funding of basic research in space physics and materials science has been indispensable.  \n- The opponent's principle overlooks the long-term vision that government projects, such as the Apollo program, provide. These projects often require significant upfront investment and risk, which private companies are less likely to undertake without guaranteed returns.  \n**Impact:** Innovation in space is a collaborative effort between government and private sectors, and the opponent's principle is overly simplistic.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:** Government regulation ensures safety and adherence to international standards, enabling sustainable growth in space activities.  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The opponent references the FAA's role in space tourism but does not provide evidence of how this oversight directly translates to global standards or international cooperation.  \n- Effective regulation must be a global effort, and the opponent's argument lacks examples of international collaboration under current regulations.  \n**Impact:** Without a global regulatory framework, national oversight alone may not ensure sustainability or adherence to international standards.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The proposition's reliance on private sector efficiency and innovation may be attacked by pointing out past failures or lack of competition.  \n- The lack of specific evidence on global regulation could be critiqued for not addressing international challenges.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- **Reinforcing Evidence:** Studies show that mixed models, combining government and private sector roles, often yield the best results. For example, the U.S. government's partnership with private companies in the Artemis program demonstrates synergy between public and private efforts.  \n- **Addressing Opposition:** While private companies can innovate rapidly, government oversight ensures that public interests, such as security and environmental protection, are not overlooked.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- The proposition's balanced approach, combining innovation, economic growth, and safety, is more comprehensive than the opposition's focus on efficiency and innovation alone.  \n- By emphasizing both direct and indirect roles of government, the proposition provides a nuanced framework that addresses potential weaknesses in relying solely on private sector oversight.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The most important disagreements revolve around the sufficiency of regulation, the role of government in innovation, and the global nature of space activities.  \n- The proposition's arguments on safety and sustainability are critical, as they address long-term viability and ethical concerns.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- The proposition provides a more holistic framework, considering both the benefits of private sector activity and the necessity of government oversight.  \n- The opponent's arguments lack a global perspective and sufficient evidence of causal relationships.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \n- Wins on key points, such as the necessity of regulation for safety and the complementary roles of government and private sectors, demonstrate that transitioning to regulation is the most effective approach for ensuring innovation, economic growth, and sustainability in space activities.  \n\n---\n\n**Judging Considerations:**  \n- **Direct Clash:** Each of the proposition's counterarguments explicitly addresses the opponent's claims, demonstrating a clear engagement with their points.  \n- **Evidence Quality:** The proposition provides specific examples and principles, such as the mixed model of government and private partnerships, which are more relevant to the motion.  \n- **Logical Validity:** Each argument is supported by clear warrants, such as the importance of government oversight in ensuring public interests.  \n\n---\n\n**Private Confidence Bet:**  \n  \n\n**Bet Amount:**",

Efficient operations reduce costs, innovation drives technological progress, and regulation ensures safety. While opponents may argue that government control maintains order, the evidence shows that private competition fosters progress. Addressing potential risks through oversight, as evidenced by FAA's role, mitigates safety concerns. The unified impact of these arguments proves that this motion is valid, ensuring space exploration is both advanced and secure.  \n\n---\n\n**Judging Considerations:**  \n- **Direct Clash:** Each argument addresses potential opposition by contrasting private innovation and efficiency against government bureaucracy.  \n- **Evidence Quality:** SpecificExamples with dates and numbers provide strong support, ensuring logical validity.  \n- **Logical Validity:** Each argument is supported by clear warrants, with explicit connections.  \n\n---\n\n**Private Confidence Bet:**  \n",
      "rebuttal": "```xml\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Rebuttal Speech\n\n**The motion is:** This House believes that governments should transition their primary role in space from direct operation to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities.\n\n---\n\n## CLASH POINT 1  \n**Original Claim:** Transitioning to regulation and oversight will boost innovation and competition in space activities.  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition points to SpaceX and Blue Origin as evidence of private innovation, but these examples are insufficient to prove that transitioning entirely to regulation will boost innovation and competition. SpaceX's success, while notable, is an outlier in the private sector. The proposition fails to account for the fact that competition in space is heavily subsidized by government contracts and partnerships. For instance, NASA's contracts with private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin have provided significant financial backing, without which these companies may not have achieved their milestones as quickly. This critique weakens the proposition's argument that private innovation alone can sustain competition without government involvement.  \n\n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it undermines the proposition's assumption that private sector innovation can replace\u653f\u5e9c\u76f4\u63a5\u8fd0\u4f5c. By highlighting the role of government subsidies, we question the sustainability of private competition in space activities.  \n\n---\n\n## CLASH POINT 2  \n**Original Claim:** Regulation and oversight will stimulate economic growth and create jobs.  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition argues that regulation will create jobs, but this principle is limited. While it is true that regulation can create jobs in oversight and compliance roles, it does not account for the broader economic impact. For example, government-run space programs, such as NASA's Apollo missions, directly created millions of jobs through public sector employment. Transitioning to regulation may shift jobs from high-wage public sector roles to lower-wage compliance and administrative positions. Additionally, the proposition's reliance on economic projections for space tourism (e.g., Virgin Galactic) is speculative and ignores the potential downsides, such as market bubbles and job displacement in traditional industries.  \n\n**Impact:** Government regulation and oversight may not stimulate economic growth as effectively as direct government operations, particularly in terms of job creation. This makes the proposition's argument weaker than it appears.  \n\n---\n\n## CLASH POINT 3  \n**Original Claim:** Governments transitioning to regulation will ensure safety and sustainability in space.  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition claims that regulation ensures safety and sustainability, but this is not supported by strong evidence. For example, the FAA's oversight of space tourism has faced criticism for being slow and insufficient. Virgin Galactic's crashes and subsequent delays demonstrate that regulatory frameworks are not always effective in ensuring safety. Furthermore, the proposition's reliance on the EU's Space Sustainability Rules (2022) is premature, as these rules are still being implemented and their impact remains to be seen. In contrast, government-run programs like NASA's have a proven track record of ensuring safety and sustainability in space exploration.  \n\n**Impact:** The proposition's claim about safety and sustainability rests on weak evidence, and we have presented stronger evidence to challenge it.  \n\n---\n\n## DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n1. The proposition's argument about private innovation relies heavily on a few successful companies and does not account for the broader private sector.  \n2. The proposition's economic growth claims are speculative and do not consider the potential downsides of transitioning to regulation.  \n3. The proposition's safety and sustainability argument is based on incomplete evidence and overstates the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- **Public sector employment data:** Government-run space programs have historically created more high-wage jobs than the private sector.  \n- **Historical examples:** The Apollo program directly employed hundreds of thousands of people and spurred technological advancements that benefited the entire economy.  \n- **Regulatory failures:** Examples like the FAA's delays in approving space tourism licenses demonstrate the limitations of regulatory oversight.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our arguments are supported by specific historical examples and data, making them more compelling than the proposition's speculative claims.  \n- We have addressed the key weaknesses in the proposition's case and provided stronger evidence to support our position.  \n\n---\n\n## WEIGHING  \n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The proposition's reliance on private innovation is insufficient without government subsidies.  \n- Regulation may not stimulate economic growth as effectively as government direct operations.  \n- The proposition's safety and sustainability argument is based on weak evidence.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- We have demonstrated that the proposition's core claims lack strong evidence and are often speculative.  \n- Our counterarguments are supported by concrete examples and data, which make our case stronger.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nBy addressing the proposition's weaknesses and providing stronger evidence, we have shown that transitioning to regulation is not the best approach for ensuring innovation, economic growth, and safety in space activities.  \n\n---",
