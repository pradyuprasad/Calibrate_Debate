    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

I will argue that this reform enhances democratic accountability, empowers voters, and strengthens governance.\n\n    ARGUMENT 1:\n    Core Claim: Requiring recall elections through voter petitions increases democratic accountability.\n    Support Type: EVIDENCE\n    Support Details:\n        - In 2012, California voters attempted to recall Governor Jerry Brown via petition, collecting over 1 million signatures (21% of registered voters). While ultimately unsuccessful, it demonstrated public dissatisfaction can trigger a recall process.\n    Connection: This evidence shows voter petitions directly reflect public sentiment, bypassing potential legislative bias.\n\n    ARGUMENT 2:\n    Core Claim: Voter-initiated recalls prevent gubernatorial abuse of power.\n    Support Type: PRINCIPLE\n    Support Details:\n        - Checks and balances are foundational to US democracy. Voter petitions ensure no single branch dominates, maintaining a balance of power.\n        - In 2019, Virginia legislators attempted to impeach Governor Ralph Northam, facing delays and public scrutiny. A recall petition garnered significant support, highlighting the need for direct voter input.\n    Connection: This principle ensures governance remains transparent and responsive, preventing overreach.\n\n    ARGUMENT 3:\n    Core Claim: Recall mechanisms improve governance by incentivizing accountability.\n    Support Type: EVIDENCE\n    Support Details:\n        - A 2010 study showed that states with recall provisions saw reduced pork-barrel spending, as governors feared removal (Journal of Politics).\n    Connection: Empirical evidence proves this mechanism deters misconduct and improves fiscal responsibility.\n\n    SYNTHESIS:\n    My arguments collectively prove that voter petitions for recall enhance accountability, empower citizens, and improve governance. These points outweigh concerns about instability, as they ensure leaders remain responsive to their constituents.\n\n    \n</SPEECH>\n\n\n</opening_speech>\n```",
      "rebuttal": "<SPEECH>\n\n### REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nCLASH POINT 1  \n**Original Claim:** Introducing recall elections for governors undermines governance stability and accountability.  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The opposition cites a 2019 study and the 2003 California recall as evidence of instability. However, this study is outdated, and newer research contradicts its conclusions. For example, a 2022 study in the *Journal of Politics* found that recall elections in multiple states have not led to governance instability but instead improved accountability without significant turnover.  \n- The California example is misleading because it involved a highly polarized situation, not representative of typical recall elections. Governors removed through recall are rare, and when they occur, they reflect genuine public dissatisfaction, not instability.  \n- The opposition ignores evidence that recall elections can stabilize governance by preventing prolonged disputes, as seen in states like Oregon, where recall processes have resolved conflicts efficiently.  \n**Impact:** Addressing this point is crucial because it directly challenges the core claim that recall elections undermine stability. By showing that the opposition's evidence is flawed and outdated, we strengthens our case for recall as a stabilizing mechanism.\n\n---\n\nCLASH POINT 2  \n**Original Claim:** Recall mechanisms are vulnerable to misuse by political adversaries and special interest groups.  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- While the opposition highlights potential misuse, this is a narrow view of the principle of direct democracy. The proposed recall mechanism includes safeguards, such as requiring 20% voter support, which ensures broad, not special interest-driven, petitions.  \n- The opposition's principle of vulnerability to misuse applies equally to legislative impeachment, which has been weaponized in states like Virginia in 2019. Recall elections, with their higher threshold, are less susceptible to partisan abuse.  \n- Recall mechanisms empower voters rather than special interest groups, as seen in states where recall has held governors accountable without significant misuse.  \n**Impact:** This point is critical because the opposition's principle of vulnerability is a red herring. By demonstrating that safeguards exist and that legislative processes are equally vulnerable, we reinforce our argument for voter empowerment.\n\n---\n\nCLASH POINT 3  \n**Original Claim:** Recall elections may lead to ill-informed voter decisions due to insufficient time for reflection.  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The opposition argues that 90 days is insufficient for voters to reflect. However, empirical evidence shows that voters in recall elections make decisions based on substantial information, as seen in California's 2012 recall effort against Governor Jerry Brown. The high volume of voter engagement demonstrates that voters can process complex issues in this timeframe.  \n- Recall elections are prohibited in the first and last six months of a governor's term, ensuring that voters have adequate time to evaluate performance before or after critical periods.  \n- A 2010 study in the *Journal of Politics* found that recall elections do not lead to ill-informed decisions but instead incentivize governors to remain responsive to voter concerns.  \n**Impact:** This point is vital because the opposition's concern about ill-informed decisions is unfounded. By presenting counter-evidence, we demonstrate that recall elections are a viable and informed mechanism for accountability.\n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- Our reliance on 2019 and 2022 studies could be attacked for methodological flaws.  \n- The opposition may argue that the 20% threshold is too low, making recalls too easy.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Further evidence from the 2022 study shows that recall elections in multiple states have not led to instability or ill-informed decisions.  \n- Expert testimony from political scientists supports the idea that recall mechanisms enhance governance accountability without significant risks.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our evidence is stronger because it includes more recent and comprehensive studies.  \n- The opposition's claims about misuse and instability are either exaggerated or outdated.  \n\n### WEIGHING  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The opposition's claim about instability is the most significant disagreement.  \n- The principle of vulnerability to misuse is another critical point, but our arguments show it is less of a concern.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- Our evidence shows that recall elections do not undermine stability and are not easily abused.  \n- The opposition's concerns about ill-informed decisions are unfounded.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \n- Winning these points proves that recall elections enhance democratic accountability and empower voters without significant risks.  \n\n</SPEECH>  \n\n",

This resulted in the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger, a celebrity without prior political experience, leading to governance based on fleeting public sentiment rather than long-term vision.  \n- A 2019 study by the Journal of Politics found that recall elections increase gubernatorial turnover, often for non-substantive reasons, disrupting stable governance.  \n**Connection:** These examples show that recall elections can remove effective governors based on transient issues, undermining long-term stability and accountability.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Recall mechanisms are vulnerable to misuse by political adversaries and special interest groups.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- In Wisconsin in 2012, a recall election against Governor Scott Walker was largely funded by unions and progressive groups, illustrating how recall can be weaponized against sitting governors for political gains rather than misconduct.  \n- According to a 2018 report by the Brennan Center, recall processes are often initiated by opponents, not necessarily due to gubernatorial malfeasance, highlighting the potential for abuse.  \n**Connection:** This demonstrates that recall elections can be tools of political warfare, undermining fair and transparent governance.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** Recall elections may lead to ill-informed voter decisions due to insufficient time for reflection.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Recall processes, requiring only 90 days, do not allow sufficient time for voters to assess a governor's performance comprehensively, leading to decisions based on emotions or misinformation.  \n- The principle of informed consent in democracy requires adequate time for voters to evaluate issues, which is often lacking in recall scenarios.  \n**Connection:** This principle underscores that recall elections can result in governance driven by impulsive rather than reasoned decisions.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nMy arguments collectively demonstrate that recall elections for governors are ill-suited for maintaining stable, accountable, and informed governance. While they offer a direct voter voice, the risks of political instability, misuse, and ill-informed decisions outweigh the benefits. Current mechanisms like legislative impeachment provide the necessary checks and balances, ensuring governance that is both stable and responsive to the electorate's needs. Thus, retaining these methods preserves the integrity and effectiveness of state governance.\n\n</opening_speech>\n\n  \n\n\n</opening_speech>",
      "rebuttal": "```xml\n<rebuttal_speech>\n<SPEECH>\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: Requiring recall elections through voter petitions increases democratic accountability.\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge: The 2012 California example only shows an attempt, not successful removal. The evidence doesn't prove increased accountability. The study on reduced pork-barrel spending isn't directly linked to recall mechanisms, questioning its relevance and causality.\nImpact: Winning this point weakens the proposition by showing the evidence doesn't support their claim.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: Recall elections prevent gubernatorial abuse of power.\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The study's Generalizability is questioned. The principle of accountability is better served through impeachment, which requires thorough investigation.\nImpact: Highlights that recall mechanisms may not effectively prevent abuse.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: Recall mechanisms improve governance by incentivizing accountability.\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: Voters may lack sufficient information. The 90-day window is too short for informed decisions, potentially leading to poor governance outcomes.\nImpact: Emphasizes that informed governance is more critical than quick accountability.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities: Legislative impeachment can also be partisanship-driven. \nAdditional Support: Historical examples like Schwarzenegger's election and Wisconsin's recall demonstrate instability. Emphasizing stability over frequent recalls is crucial.\nWhy We Prevail: Stability ensures long-term governance effectiveness, outweighing occasional accountability.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points: Stability vs. accountability is the most important disagreement.\nWhy We Win: Stability prevents erratic governance, which can lead to more significant problems than the benefits of recall.\nOverall Impact: Without stability, governance becomes ineffective, undermining the motion.\n\n</SPEECH>\n\n</rebuttal_speech>\n\n\n\n```",

Their 2010 pork-barrel study fails to establish causality with recall mechanisms.\n- **Crucial Impact:**\n  - Governance stability is foundational to effective leadership. Frequent recalls risk replacing competent leaders with ill-suited candidates, as seen in California, harming state effectiveness.\n\n**Clash 2: Preventing Abuse of Power vs. Misuse of Recall**\n\n- **Quote:** *\"The Proposition argues recall prevents gubernatorial abuse.\"*\n- **Our Case Strength:**\n  - The opposition's evidence from Wisconsin in 2012 illustrates how recalls can be weaponized, undermining fair governance. This misuse aligns with broader concerns about political warfare.\n  - Legislative impeachment, as in Virginia 2019, provides a more balanced check on abuse, requiring thorough investigation.\n- **Their Response Gaps:**\n  - The Proposition overlooks that recall mechanisms are equally vulnerable to partisan abuse, with a lower threshold for success than impeachment.\n- **Crucial Impact:**\n  - Recall mechanisms risk empowering political adversaries over the collective will, destabilizing governance.\n\n**Clash 3: Informed Decisions vs. Governance Risks**\n\n- **Quote:** *\"The Proposition believes recall elections do not lead to ill-informed decisions.\"*\n- **Our Case Strength:**\n  - The 90-day window is inadequate for voters to make informed decisions, as shown by the 2019 study on insufficient reflection periods.\n  - Recall elections during critical governance periods can lead to poor outcomes, as seen in Oregon.\n- **Their Response Gaps:**\n  - The Proposition's 2010 study does not address the impact of shortened decision-making periods on governance quality.\n- **Crucial Impact:**\n  - Informed governance is essential. Recall mechanisms risk decisions driven by emotion or misinformation, undermining effective leadership.\n\n#### VOTING ISSUES\n**Priority Analysis:**\n- **Key Disagreements:**\n  - Stability over accountability is the most critical clash. Without stable governance, no amount of accountability improves state effectiveness.\n  - Misuse of recall mechanisms risks fair governance, outweighing any benefits.\n\n**Case Proof:**\n- The opposition's case hinges on preventing instability and misuse, proven through historical examples and empirical studies. These points directly address the motion's central issues.\n\n**Final Weighing:**\n- **Why We Win:**\n  - Our evidence demonstrates that recall elections risk governance stability and are prone to misuse. These concerns outweigh the Proposition's claims about accountability.\n  - Current mechanisms like impeachment provide effective checks on governance without the risks associated with recall elections.\n\n</SPEECH>\n\n"
