    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\n**Core Claim:** Governments should maintain their primary role in direct operation of space activities rather than transitioning to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \nThe principle of national security and strategic autonomy necessitates that governments retain direct control over space operations. Space is a critical domain for defense, communication, and scientific advancement, and ceding control to private entities could compromise national interests. Private companies, driven by profit motives, may prioritize commercial gains over long-term strategic goals or ethical considerations. Governments, as stewards of public interest, are better positioned to ensure that space activities align with national and global security needs.  \n**Connection:** This principle demonstrates that direct government operation is essential to safeguard national security and maintain strategic autonomy in space, which cannot be guaranteed under a regulatory framework dominated by private entities.  \n\n---\n\n**Core Claim:** Direct government operation ensures equitable access to space resources and benefits, which private sector dominance could undermine.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \nHistorically, government-led space programs like NASA and ESA have prioritized scientific discovery and public benefit, such as the Apollo missions and the International Space Station. In contrast, private companies like SpaceX focus on profitability, often limiting access to their technologies and services. For example, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink project, while innovative, has raised concerns about monopolistic control over satellite internet services. Government-led initiatives ensure that space resources are accessible to all, fostering global collaboration and reducing inequality.  \n**Connection:** This evidence shows that direct government operation is necessary to prevent the privatization of space resources and ensure equitable access for all nations and communities.  \n\n---\n\n**Core Claim:** Governments have the capacity to undertake long-term, high-risk space projects that private companies cannot sustain.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \nGovernment space agencies have successfully executed long-term, high-risk projects like the Hubble Space Telescope and the Mars Rover missions, which required decades of investment and commitment. Private companies, constrained by shareholder expectations and profit margins, are less likely to undertake such projects. For instance, while SpaceX has made significant strides in reusable rocket technology, its focus remains on commercially viable ventures rather than exploratory or scientific missions.  \n**Connection:** This evidence highlights that governments are uniquely positioned to lead ambitious, long-term space projects that drive scientific and technological progress, which private companies are unlikely to prioritize.  \n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThese arguments collectively demonstrate that governments must retain their primary role in direct space operations to ensure national security, equitable access to space resources, and the pursuit of long-term, high-risk projects. Transitioning to a regulatory role would risk ceding control to profit-driven private entities, undermining these critical objectives. The real-world impact of this shift would be a fragmented and inequitable space sector, with diminished capacity for scientific and strategic advancements.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "REBUTTAL STRUCTURE\n\nCLASH POINT 1  \nOriginal Claim: \"Private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin focus on profitable ventures such as satellite launches and space tourism, while neglecting critical public goods like planetary defense or global satellite internet access for underserved regions.\"  \nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique  \nChallenge:  \nThe evidence provided is incomplete and misrepresents the capabilities of private companies. While it is true that private entities prioritize profitability, they have also demonstrated the ability to address public needs when incentivized. For example, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink has provided satellite internet to Ukraine during the war, showcasing its potential for public benefit. Additionally, private companies often collaborate with governments on critical projects, such as SpaceX\u2019s partnership with NASA for the Artemis program. The claim that private companies \"neglect\" public goods ignores these examples and oversimplifies their role.  \nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it undermines the opposition\u2019s assertion that private companies cannot contribute to public goods, weakening their argument for exclusive government operation.  \n\n---\n\nCLASH POINT 2  \nOriginal Claim: \"The principle of intergenerational responsibility requires governments to protect space as a shared resource for future generations, preventing over-exploitation and environmental degradation.\"  \nChallenge Type: Principle Critique  \nChallenge:  \nWhile the principle of intergenerational responsibility is valid, it does not inherently require direct government operation. Effective regulation can achieve the same goals by setting strict environmental and sustainability standards for private entities. For example, the Outer Space Treaty already establishes a framework for responsible space use, which can be enforced through robust regulatory mechanisms. The opposition\u2019s principle fails to consider that governments can fulfill their intergenerational responsibilities through oversight rather than direct operation.  \nImpact: This critique is essential because it challenges the opposition\u2019s foundational principle, showing that regulation can achieve the same objectives without requiring government-led operations.  \n\n---\n\nCLASH POINT 3  \nOriginal Claim: \"Regulatory capture is a well-documented phenomenon where industries influence their regulators to act in their favor, undermining public interest.\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence  \nChallenge:  \nWhile regulatory capture is a risk, it is not inevitable. Governments can implement safeguards to prevent it, such as transparent decision-making processes, independent oversight bodies, and strict conflict-of-interest rules. For example, the European Space Agency (ESA) has successfully regulated private space activities without significant issues of capture. Additionally, private companies often face public scrutiny and market pressures that deter unethical behavior. The opposition\u2019s evidence overstates the risk of regulatory capture without considering these mitigating factors.  \nImpact: Winning this point is critical because it counters the opposition\u2019s claim that regulation is inherently flawed, demonstrating that effective oversight is achievable.  \n\n---\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \nVulnerabilities:  \n- The opposition may argue that private companies\u2019 contributions to public goods are exceptions rather than the norm.  \n- They might claim that regulation alone is insufficient to address the complexity of space activities.  \nAdditional Support:  \n- Highlight examples of successful public-private partnerships, such as NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, which combines government oversight with private innovation.  \n- Emphasize that regulation can be strengthened through international cooperation and technological advancements.  \nWhy We Prevail:  \nOur responses directly address the opposition\u2019s claims with evidence and reasoning, showing that private companies can contribute to public goods, regulation can achieve intergenerational responsibility, and regulatory capture can be mitigated.  \n\n---\n\nWEIGHING  \nKey Clash Points:  \n- The role of private companies in addressing public needs.  \n- The effectiveness of regulation versus direct operation in achieving long-term goals.  \nWhy We Win:  \nWe demonstrate that private companies can and do contribute to public goods, and that regulation can effectively address the opposition\u2019s concerns. Our arguments provide a more balanced and practical approach to space governance.  \nOverall Impact: Winning these points proves that transitioning to a regulatory role does not compromise public interests and can enhance the efficiency and innovation of space activities.  \n\n",
      "closing": "### FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE  \n\n#### FRAMING  \n**Core Questions:**  \nThe fundamental issues in this debate revolve around whether governments should retain direct operation of space activities or transition to a regulatory role overseeing private sector activities. The key decisions are:  \n1. Which approach better ensures national security and strategic autonomy?  \n2. Which model promotes equitable access to space resources?  \n3. Which system is better suited for undertaking long-term, high-risk projects?  \n**Evaluation Framework:** This debate should be judged based on the comparative ability of direct government operation versus regulatory oversight to address these critical issues, weighing evidence, principles, and real-world impacts.  \n\n---\n\n#### KEY CLASHES  \n\n**CLASH 1: National Security and Strategic Autonomy**  \n**Quote:** \"Governments must retain direct operation of space activities to ensure national security and strategic autonomy.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \nOur evidence shows that private companies like SpaceX have collaborated with governments on secure satellite launches, demonstrating that private entities can align with national security goals under a regulatory framework. This directly counters the proposition\u2019s claim that direct government operation is essential for security.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe proposition failed to address how robust regulation can enforce national security protocols without requiring direct government operation.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is pivotal because it challenges the proposition\u2019s foundational argument that direct operation is necessary for national security, showing that regulation can achieve the same objectives more efficiently.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH 2: Equitable Access to Space Resources**  \n**Quote:** \"Direct government operation ensures equitable access to space resources, which private companies would undermine.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \nWe provided counter evidence that private innovation, such as SpaceX\u2019s reusable rocket technology, has expanded access to space resources more effectively than government programs. Examples like Rocket Lab enabling New Zealand\u2019s entry into the space sector further demonstrate this.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe proposition ignored the role of private sector innovation in reducing costs and expanding accessibility, overemphasizing their profit motives without acknowledging their contributions.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWinning this clash shows that private sector involvement enhances equitable access, undermining the proposition\u2019s argument for exclusive government operation.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH 3: Long-Term, High-Risk Projects**  \n**Quote:** \"Governments are better equipped to undertake long-term, high-risk space projects that private companies cannot sustain.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \nOur evidence highlighted private companies\u2019 capacity to manage ambitious projects, such as SpaceX\u2019s Starship program and their collaboration with NASA on crewed missions to the ISS. This demonstrates that private entities can lead high-risk initiatives, often through public-private partnerships.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe proposition failed to address how public-private partnerships can share risks and costs, making ambitious projects feasible without sole reliance on government funding.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is critical because it disproves the proposition\u2019s claim that governments are uniquely positioned for long-term projects, showing the private sector\u2019s capability in this area.  \n\n---\n\n#### VOTING ISSUES  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most important clash is national security and strategic autonomy because it addresses the core concern of whether space activities align with public interests. Equitable access and long-term projects are secondary but crucial for demonstrating the broader benefits of private sector involvement.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning these clashes proves that transitioning to a regulatory role does not compromise national security, equitable access, or ambitious projects. Instead, it enhances efficiency and innovation while maintaining alignment with public interests.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nEven if the proposition wins minor points, our victories on national security, equitable access, and long-term projects overwhelmingly demonstrate that transitioning to regulation is the superior approach. The real-world impact of this shift would be a more innovative, accessible, and sustainable space sector, guided by effective government oversight.  \n\n"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Governments should not transition to primarily regulating private space activities because private entities prioritize profit over public benefits, leading to inequitable outcomes.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin focus on profitable ventures such as satellite launches and space tourism, while neglecting critical public goods like planetary defense or global satellite internet access for underserved regions. For example, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink project has primarily served wealthier nations, leaving many developing countries without affordable access.  \n- Without government-led initiatives, projects like NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to explore the Moon for scientific and public benefit, would lack funding and direction.  \n**Connection:** This evidence demonstrates that private companies, driven by profit motives, cannot be trusted to address global needs in space, making government direct operation essential.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Governments are better equipped to ensure safety and sustainability in space activities due to their long-term perspective and accountability to the public.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The principle of intergenerational responsibility requires governments to protect space as a shared resource for future generations, preventing over-exploitation and environmental degradation.  \n- Private companies, by contrast, often prioritize short-term gains, leading to practices like space debris accumulation, as seen in the increasing number of defunct satellites in low Earth orbit.  \n**Connection:** This principle shows that governments, with their focus on public welfare and sustainability, must continue to lead space operations to ensure long-term safety and equity.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** Transitioning to a regulatory role risks creating conflicts of interest and weak oversight, as governments may lack the technical expertise to effectively regulate private entities.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Regulatory capture is a well-documented phenomenon where industries influence their regulators to act in their favor, undermining public interest. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been criticized for being too lenient on private space companies like SpaceX during safety reviews.  \n- Governments often lack the specialized knowledge required to regulate complex space technologies, leading to ineffective oversight.  \n**Connection:** This evidence highlights the risks of relying on governments to regulate private space activities, making direct operation a more reliable approach.  \n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThese arguments together demonstrate that governments must retain their primary role in directly operating space activities. Private companies\u2019 profit-driven motives, governments\u2019 long-term accountability, and the risks of regulatory failure all underscore the necessity of continued government leadership in space. By maintaining direct operation, governments can ensure equitable access, safety, and sustainability, which are essential for the responsible use of space as a global commons.  \n\n",
      "rebuttal": "### REBUTTAL STRUCTURE  \n\n#### CLASH POINT 1  \n**Original Claim:** Governments must retain direct operation of space activities to ensure national security and strategic autonomy.  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of national security and strategic autonomy assumes that private space companies cannot align with national interests, which is overly simplistic. Private entities often collaborate closely with governments and adhere to national security protocols. For instance, SpaceX has worked with the U.S. Department of Defense on secure satellite launches, demonstrating that private companies can operate within national strategic frameworks. Additionally, governments can enforce stringent regulations to ensure private activities align with security goals without needing to operate directly.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point undermines the proposition\u2019s claim that direct government operation is essential for national security, showing that regulation can achieve the same goals more efficiently.  \n\n#### CLASH POINT 2  \n**Original Claim:** Direct government operation ensures equitable access to space resources, which private companies would undermine.  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \nPrivate companies have demonstrated their ability to expand access to space resources more effectively than government programs. For example, SpaceX\u2019s reusable rocket technology has significantly reduced the cost of space launches, making space more accessible to smaller nations and organizations. Moreover, private initiatives like Rocket Lab have enabled countries like New Zealand to enter the space sector, which would have been prohibitively expensive under traditional government-led models.  \n**Impact:** This evidence shows that private sector innovation can enhance equitable access to space, challenging the proposition\u2019s claim that government operation is necessary for this purpose.  \n\n#### CLASH POINT 3  \n**Original Claim:** Governments are better equipped to undertake long-term, high-risk space projects that private companies cannot sustain.  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \nPrivate companies have increasingly demonstrated their ability to manage long-term, high-risk projects. For example, SpaceX\u2019s Starship program aims to achieve interplanetary travel, a goal that rivals the ambition of government-led projects like NASA\u2019s Artemis program. Additionally, private companies often leverage public-private partnerships to share risks and costs, such as SpaceX\u2019s collaboration with NASA on crewed missions to the International Space Station.  \n**Impact:** This evidence highlights that private companies are capable of leading ambitious space projects, weakening the proposition\u2019s claim that governments are uniquely positioned to do so.  \n\n---\n\n#### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s argument about private companies prioritizing profit could be challenged if the proposition emphasizes historical examples of private sector failures.  \n- The proposition may argue that private companies\u2019 focus on cost-cutting compromises safety, citing incidents like the recent Starship test failures.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Highlight that private companies are subject to stringent government regulations, ensuring they align with public interests.  \n- Emphasize the efficiency and innovation benefits of private sector involvement, which can complement rather than replace government oversight.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur evidence and analysis demonstrate that private companies can align with national security, expand access to space, and undertake ambitious projects, all under a robust regulatory framework. This undermines the proposition\u2019s core claims and supports the motion.  \n\n---\n\n#### WEIGHING  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. National security and strategic autonomy: Our critique shows that regulation can achieve these goals without direct government operation.  \n2. Equitable access to space: Our counter evidence demonstrates that private innovation enhances accessibility.  \n3. Long-term, high-risk projects: Private companies have proven their capability to lead ambitious initiatives.  \n**Why We Win:**  \nOur arguments directly refute the proposition\u2019s key claims using stronger evidence and principles, showing that transitioning to a regulatory role is not only feasible but superior.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these points proves that private sector involvement, coupled with effective government regulation, can better achieve the goals of security, accessibility, and innovation in space.  \n\n",
      "closing": "### FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE  \n\n#### FRAMING  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. Does direct government operation of space activities better ensure national security, equitable access, and long-term projects compared to a regulatory role?  \n2. Can private sector activities, under effective regulation, address these concerns more efficiently and innovatively?  \n**Key Decisions:**  \n- The balance between government leadership and private sector innovation.  \n- The feasibility of transitioning to a regulatory role without compromising public interests.  \n**Evaluation Framework:**  \nThe debate should be evaluated based on whether transitional government regulation can achieve the goals of security, accessibility, and sustainability more effectively than direct government operation.  \n\n---\n\n#### KEY CLASHES  \n**Clash 1: National Security and Strategic Autonomy**  \n**Quote:**  \nProposition: \"The principle of national security and strategic autonomy necessitates that governments retain direct control over space operations.\"  \nOpposition: \"Private companies often collaborate closely with governments and adhere to national security protocols.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Private companies like SpaceX have demonstrated alignment with national security goals through partnerships with the Department of Defense.  \n- Regulatory frameworks can enforce strict compliance with security protocols, ensuring private activities align with national interests.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition assumes private companies cannot be trusted with national security, ignoring successful collaborations.  \n- They fail to show why regulation cannot achieve the same security objectives as direct operation.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nNational security is a top priority, and our evidence shows that regulation can safeguard it without requiring direct government operation.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Equitable Access to Space Resources**  \n**Quote:**  \nProposition: \"Direct government operation ensures equitable access to space resources, which private sector dominance could undermine.\"  \nOpposition: \"Private companies have demonstrated their ability to expand access to space resources more effectively than government programs.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- SpaceX\u2019s reusable rocket technology has dramatically reduced launch costs, making space more accessible to smaller nations and organizations.  \n- Private initiatives like Rocket Lab have enabled countries like New Zealand to enter the space sector, which would have been prohibitively expensive under traditional government-led models.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition focuses on historical government-led programs like NASA but ignores the limitations of their scalability and cost-effectiveness.  \n- They fail to address how private sector innovation can enhance accessibility.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nEnsuring equitable access to space is essential, and private sector innovation under regulation can achieve this more effectively than government-led programs.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Long-Term, High-Risk Projects**  \n**Quote:**  \nProposition: \"Governments have the capacity to undertake long-term, high-risk space projects that private companies cannot sustain.\"  \nOpposition: \"Private companies have increasingly demonstrated their ability to manage long-term, high-risk projects.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- SpaceX\u2019s Starship program, which aims for interplanetary travel, rivals the ambition of government-led projects like NASA\u2019s Artemis program.  \n- Public-private partnerships, such as SpaceX\u2019s collaboration with NASA on crewed missions, demonstrate that private companies can sustain long-term projects.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition assumes private companies are inherently short-term focused, ignoring their track record of ambitious projects.  \n- They fail to recognize the efficiency and innovation benefits of private sector involvement in long-term initiatives.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \nLong-term, high-risk projects drive progress in space exploration, and private companies, under regulation, can lead these efforts as effectively as governments.  \n\n---\n\n#### VOTING ISSUES  \n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most critical clash is national security, as it underpins all space activities. However, equitable access and long-term projects are also essential for evaluating the feasibility of transitioning to a regulatory role.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Winning Clash 1 shows that regulation can safeguard national security without direct government operation.  \n- Winning Clash 2 demonstrates that private sector innovation enhances equitable access to space.  \n- Winning Clash 3 proves that private companies can lead long-term, high-risk projects under regulation.  \n**Final Weighing:**  \nEven if the proposition wins on some minor points, our victories on the key clashes show that transitioning to a regulatory role is not only feasible but superior in achieving the goals of security, accessibility, and innovation.  \n\n---\n\n"
