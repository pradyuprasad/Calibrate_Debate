    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Well-designed recall mechanisms can enhance accountability without causing instability.\n- The Venezuelan example is not directly comparable to the US context, as Venezuela has different political and institutional structures.\n- The proposed mechanism includes safeguards, such as the 20% threshold and the prohibition during the first and last 6 months, which mitigate the risk of instability.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it challenges the opposition's core argument that recall elections inherently undermine stability, allowing us to defend the motion's balance between stability and accountability.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"Voter-initiated recalls are susceptible to manipulation by wealthy and well-organized interest groups, disenfranchising ordinary voters.\"\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge:\n- While the California example shows that recalls can be influenced by special interests, this does not mean that all recall elections are inherently flawed.\n- The 20% threshold is designed to ensure that recalls reflect significant public concern, not just the interests of a small group.\n- The opposition does not provide evidence that the 20% threshold is insufficient to prevent manipulation. In fact, this threshold is higher than in many existing recall systems.\n- The prohibition during the first and last 6 months further reduces the risk of manipulation by limiting the window for recall attempts.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it undermines the opposition's claim that the recall mechanism is inherently vulnerable to manipulation, allowing us to defend the motion's design as a balanced approach.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: \"State legislative impeachment provides a more measured and accountable process for removing governors than voter-initiated recalls.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge:\n- While impeachment is a measured process, it is also subject to political partisanship and may not reflect the will of the electorate.\n- The principle of direct democracy holds that voters should have a direct mechanism to hold their leaders accountable, not just through their representatives.\n- The proposed recall mechanism complements impeachment by providing an additional check on executive power, ensuring that governors are accountable to both the legislature and the electorate.\n- The opposition does not address how impeachment can be used for partisan purposes, which undermines its claim that it is a more accountable process.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it challenges the opposition's claim that impeachment is inherently superior, allowing us to defend the motion's emphasis on direct democratic accountability.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- The opposition may argue that the 20% threshold is still too low and that the prohibition periods are insufficient to prevent instability.\n- They may also claim that the recall mechanism could still be influenced by special interests, despite the safeguards.\nAdditional Support:\n- We can provide additional evidence from other states with recall mechanisms that have not experienced significant instability or manipulation.\n- We can emphasize that the recall mechanism is a supplementary tool, not a replacement for impeachment, and that it enhances democratic accountability.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our arguments directly challenge the opposition's core claims and provide a balanced defense of the motion's design.\n- We have shown that the proposed recall mechanism includes safeguards that mitigate the risks identified by the opposition.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements are whether recall elections inherently undermine stability, whether they are vulnerable to manipulation, and whether impeachment is a superior mechanism.\nWhy We Win:\n- We have successfully critiqued the opposition's principles and evidence, showing that the proposed recall mechanism is a balanced approach that enhances accountability without causing instability.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning these key points demonstrates that the motion is a reasonable and effective way to enhance democratic accountability while maintaining stability.\n\n",
      "closing": "### PROPOSITION CLOSING SPEECH\n\n**FRAMING**  \nThe core issue in this debate is whether introducing voter-initiated recall elections, as proposed in the motion, enhances or undermines democratic governance. The key decision lies in balancing the principles of democratic stability, accountability, and fairness. The debate should be evaluated based on whether the proposed mechanism strengthens democratic oversight without creating instability or enabling manipulation.\n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Democratic Stability vs. Accountability**  \n**Quote:**  \nOpposition: \"Recall elections through voter petitions undermine democratic stability and governance.\"  \nProposition: \"The principle of stable governance must be balanced with the principle of democratic accountability.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \nWe have shown that the proposed recall mechanism includes safeguards (20% threshold, prohibition periods) that prevent frivolous recalls while allowing legitimate public oversight. The opposition's reliance on the Venezuelan example is flawed, as it lacks comparable safeguards. Our mechanism strikes a balance between stability and accountability, ensuring governors can govern effectively while remaining answerable to voters.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe opposition fails to address how the safeguards in our mechanism mitigate instability. They also misapply the principle of stable governance by conflating it with immunity from accountability.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWinning this clash is essential because it demonstrates that the proposed mechanism enhances accountability without undermining governance, addressing the core concern of the debate.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Manipulation by Special Interests**  \n**Quote:**  \nOpposition: \"The 20% threshold for voter petitions is too low and can be easily manipulated by special interest groups.\"  \nProposition: \"The 20% threshold is sufficient to ensure that recalls reflect significant public concern.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \nWe have provided evidence from states like Wisconsin and Michigan, where recall mechanisms with similar thresholds have been used responsibly. The 20% threshold is a significant barrier, requiring broad-based support to initiate a recall. This prevents manipulation by ensuring recalls reflect genuine public discontent, not the whims of special interests.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe opposition relies on the 2003 California recall as an outlier, ignoring the broader pattern of responsible use in other states. They also fail to address how our mechanism's prohibition periods further reduce the risk of manipulation.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWinning this clash is critical because it shows that the proposed mechanism is not inherently vulnerable to manipulation, addressing a key opposition concern.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Legislative Impeachment vs. Voter-Initiated Recalls**  \n**Quote:**  \nOpposition: \"State legislative impeachment provides a more measured and accountable process for removing governors than voter-initiated recalls.\"  \nProposition: \"The recall mechanism complements impeachment by ensuring governors are accountable to both the legislature and the electorate.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \nWe have argued that legislative impeachment is often subject to partisan gridlock, making it less effective as an accountability mechanism. The recall mechanism provides a direct democratic check, ensuring governors remain answerable to voters, not just elected representatives.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe opposition does not address how impeachment can be used for partisan purposes, undermining its claim of superior accountability. They also fail to explain why direct democratic oversight is less legitimate than legislative oversight.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWinning this clash is crucial because it demonstrates that the recall mechanism strengthens democratic accountability by providing a supplementary check on executive power.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most important clashes are whether the recall mechanism undermines stability and whether it is vulnerable to manipulation. These issues directly address the core concerns of the debate and determine the overall viability of the motion.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWe have shown that the proposed mechanism includes safeguards that prevent instability and manipulation, ensuring it enhances democratic accountability. By addressing the opposition's concerns with evidence and principle-based arguments, we have demonstrated that the motion is both necessary and balanced.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nOur victories on the key clashes prove that the motion strengthens democratic governance by providing a reliable and fair mechanism for holding governors accountable. The opposition's arguments, while well-intentioned, are based on misapplied principles and selective evidence, failing to undermine our case.  \n\n---\n\n**CONCLUSION**  \nThe proposition has successfully defended the motion by showing that the proposed recall mechanism enhances democratic accountability without undermining stability or enabling manipulation. By balancing the principles of stability, accountability, and fairness, the motion represents a necessary reform that strengthens democratic governance.  \n\n"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: Introducing voter-initiated recall elections undermines democratic stability by subjecting governors to constant political pressure and short-term populist demands.\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n- The principle of democratic stability requires that elected officials have sufficient time to implement their policies without being constantly threatened by removal.\n- Historically, systems with frequent recall mechanisms have led to political instability, as seen in countries like Venezuela, where recall referendums have been used to destabilize governments.\n- The US Constitution was designed to balance direct democracy with checks and balances, ensuring that officials are not removed for purely partisan reasons.\nConnection: Allowing voter-initiated recall elections would erode the stability and effectiveness of governance by subjecting governors to unpredictable and potentially frivolous removal attempts.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: Voter-initiated recalls are susceptible to manipulation by wealthy and well-organized interest groups, disenfranchising ordinary voters.\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- In California, the 2003 recall of Governor Gray Davis was heavily influenced by wealthy donors and special interest groups, who spent millions to promote the recall.\n- Research shows that voter-initiated recalls disproportionately benefit well-funded campaigns, as they can gather signatures more efficiently through paid circulators.\n- This creates an inequitable system where the voices of ordinary citizens are drowned out by those with financial resources.\nConnection: A recall system based on voter petitions would not represent the will of the majority but rather the influence of powerful and well-organized minorities, undermining democratic fairness.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\nCore Claim: State legislative impeachment provides a more measured and accountable process for removing governors than voter-initiated recalls.\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n- Impeachment is a deliberative process that requires evidence of serious misconduct, ensuring that governors are not removed for trivial or partisan reasons.\n- It involves elected representatives who are accountable to voters and can weigh the broader implications of removal.\n- This process aligns with the constitutional principle that removal of officials should be based on serious breaches of public trust, not transient political disagreements.\nConnection: Legislative impeachment ensures that the removal of a governor is a reasoned and responsible decision, unlike the potentially chaotic and unpredictable nature of voter-initiated recalls.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n- Together, these arguments demonstrate that introducing voter-initiated recall elections would destabilize governance, disenfranchise ordinary voters, and create opportunities for manipulation.\n- Legislative impeachment provides a more balanced and accountable mechanism for addressing serious misconduct.\n- Protecting the stability and integrity of democratic institutions requires rejecting the proposed recall system and maintaining existing impeachment processes.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "### REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Recall elections through voter petitions undermine democratic stability and governance.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of stable governance is indeed important, but the proposition misapplies it. Stable governance does not mean immunity from accountability. The proposed recall mechanism includes safeguards, such as the 20% threshold and the prohibition during the first and last 6 months of the term, which prevent frivolous recalls while still allowing for legitimate public oversight. Historical examples like Venezuela are not directly comparable, as they lack such safeguards. The principle of stable governance must be balanced with the principle of democratic accountability, which the proposition fails to do.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it shows that the recall mechanism can coexist with stable governance, undermining the proposition's core argument.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The 20% threshold for voter petitions is too low and can be easily manipulated by special interest groups.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \nWhile the proposition cites California's 2003 recall as evidence of manipulation, this example is an outlier rather than the norm. In states like Wisconsin and Michigan, recall mechanisms with similar thresholds have been used responsibly, reflecting genuine public discontent rather than special interest manipulation. Additionally, the 20% threshold is a significant barrier, requiring broad-based support to initiate a recall. The proposition's evidence is selective and does not account for the majority of cases where recall mechanisms function as intended.  \n**Impact:** This point is critical because it demonstrates that the 20% threshold is sufficient to prevent manipulation, countering the proposition's claim of vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Prohibiting removal during the first and last 6 months of a term creates unnecessary rigidity in the recall process.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition misinterprets the principle of accountability. Accountability does not require constant vulnerability to recall; it requires mechanisms that ensure officials are held responsible for their actions. The prohibition during the first and last 6 months prevents recalls from being used as tools of political sabotage during critical periods, such as the transition of power or the early stages of policy implementation. This safeguard ensures that recalls are used for legitimate reasons, not as partisan weapons.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is essential because it shows that the prohibition periods enhance, rather than weaken, the accountability mechanism.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition's reliance on historical examples could be challenged if the proposition provides more recent or relevant cases.  \n- The argument about the 20% threshold could be weakened if the proposition presents evidence of widespread manipulation in other states.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Emphasize that the recall mechanism is a last resort, not a frequent occurrence, which minimizes the risk of instability.  \n- Highlight that legislative impeachment is often subject to partisan gridlock, making it less effective than voter-initiated recalls.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur arguments directly address the proposition's claims with stronger evidence and principles, showing that the recall mechanism is both necessary and balanced.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The balance between stability and accountability is the most critical issue, as it determines the overall effectiveness of the recall mechanism.  \n- The 20% threshold and prohibition periods are key safeguards that the proposition fails to adequately address.  \n**Why We Win:**  \nOur arguments demonstrate that the recall mechanism enhances accountability without undermining stability, while the proposition's claims are based on selective evidence and misapplied principles.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these points proves that the motion is a necessary reform that strengthens democratic governance by providing a balanced mechanism for holding governors accountable.\n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "### FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE  \n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n- The fundamental issue in this debate is whether introducing voter-initiated recall elections enhances or undermines democratic governance.  \n- The key decisions revolve around balancing stability, accountability, and protection against manipulation.  \n- The debate should be evaluated based on which side better upholds democratic principles of stability, accountability, and fairness, and which mechanism (recall elections or impeachment) is more effective in achieving these goals.  \n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Stability vs. Accountability**  \n**Quote:**  \nOpposition: \"Introducing voter-initiated recall elections undermines democratic stability by subjecting governors to constant political pressure and short-term populist demands.\"  \nProposition: \"The principle of stable governance is important, but it must be balanced with the principle of democratic accountability.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Stable governance requires that elected officials have the time and space to implement policies without constant fear of removal.  \n- Historical examples like Venezuela demonstrate how recall mechanisms can destabilize governance, and the US Constitution\u2019s design prioritizes stability over frequent direct interventions.  \n- The proposition\u2019s safeguards (20% threshold, prohibition periods) do not fully address the risks of instability, as even these thresholds can be manipulated or used for partisan purposes.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition fails to provide evidence that recall elections can coexist with stability in the US context, relying instead on theoretical balancing rather than practical examples.  \n- They incorrectly assume that Venezuela\u2019s instability is irrelevant, ignoring the broader principle that recall mechanisms can be weaponized in any political system.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Winning this clash is essential because it determines whether the motion prioritizes stability or accountability. Our arguments show that recall elections inherently threaten stability, which is a cornerstone of effective governance.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Manipulation by Special Interests**  \n**Quote:**  \nOpposition: \"Voter-initiated recalls are susceptible to manipulation by wealthy and well-organized interest groups, disenfranchising ordinary voters.\"  \nProposition: \"The 20% threshold is designed to ensure that recalls reflect significant public concern, not just the interests of a small group.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Evidence from California\u2019s 2003 recall shows how special interests with financial resources can dominate the process, undermining democratic fairness.  \n- Research demonstrates that recall systems disproportionately benefit well-funded campaigns, as paid circulators can gather signatures more efficiently.  \n- The 20% threshold is insufficient to prevent this, as it still allows a relatively small, well-organized group to initiate a recall.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition\u2019s claim that the 20% threshold is sufficient is unsupported by evidence, and they fail to address how special interests can still exploit this threshold.  \n- Their reliance on outlier examples like Wisconsin and Michigan ignores the broader trend of manipulation in recall systems.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Winning this clash is critical because it shows that the recall mechanism is inherently vulnerable to manipulation, undermining democratic fairness and the will of the majority.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Impeachment vs. Recalls**  \n**Quote:**  \nOpposition: \"State legislative impeachment provides a more measured and accountable process for removing governors than voter-initiated recalls.\"  \nProposition: \"Impeachment is subject to political partisanship and may not reflect the will of the electorate.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Impeachment is a deliberative process that requires evidence of serious misconduct, ensuring that governors are not removed for trivial or partisan reasons.  \n- It involves elected representatives who are accountable to voters and can weigh the broader implications of removal.  \n- The proposition\u2019s claim that impeachment is inherently partisan is speculative and ignores the checks and balances built into the process.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition fails to provide evidence that impeachment is more partisan than recall elections, which are also susceptible to political manipulation.  \n- They do not address how recall elections can be used for partisan purposes, undermining their claim that they are more accountable.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Winning this clash is essential because it demonstrates that impeachment is a more balanced and accountable mechanism for removing governors, ensuring that removal is based on serious breaches of public trust rather than transient political disagreements.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n**Priority Analysis:**  \n- The most important clashes are stability vs. accountability (Clash 1) and protection against manipulation (Clash 2), as these directly address the core principles of democratic governance.  \n- The comparison between impeachment and recall elections (Clash 3) is also crucial, as it determines which mechanism is more effective in upholding these principles.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Winning these clashes demonstrates that the proposed recall mechanism undermines stability, is vulnerable to manipulation, and is less accountable than impeachment.  \n- This proves that the motion would lead to negative outcomes for democratic governance, and that maintaining the current impeachment process is the better option.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \n- Our arguments show that the risks of recall elections outweigh any theoretical benefits, and that impeachment provides a more balanced and effective mechanism for accountability.  \n- The proposition\u2019s claims are based on misapplied principles and selective evidence, failing to demonstrate that their proposal would enhance democratic governance.  \n\n---\n\n**Final Statement:**  \nThe opposition has demonstrated that the proposed recall mechanism undermines stable governance, is vulnerable to manipulation, and is less effective than impeachment. The motion must be rejected to protect the stability, fairness, and accountability of democratic institutions.  \n\n---\n\n"
