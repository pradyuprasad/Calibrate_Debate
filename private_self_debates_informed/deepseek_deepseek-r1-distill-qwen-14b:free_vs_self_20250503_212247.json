    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "rebuttal": "**Opposition Rebuttal Speech**\n\n**Motion:** This House would require US state governors to face recall elections through voter petitions (requiring 20% of registered voters within 90 days) rather than allowing removal during their term only through state legislative impeachment, with both mechanisms prohibited during the first and last 6 months of their term.\n\n---\n\n**Clash Point 1: Recall Elections Lead to Political Instability and Misuse**\n\n**Opponent's Claim:** Recall mechanisms can result in frequent changes in leadership, disrupting governance and policy continuity.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\nWhile it's feared that recall elections may lead to instability, the reality is that they are a necessary tool for removing ineffective or corrupt leaders. The threat of instability is overstated. In fact, recall elections provide a check on governance, ensuring that leaders remain accountable to the people. Voters, when given the choice, often prefer experienced leaders, as seen in studies where recall elections have not led to chaotic governance but have instead corrected mismanagement.\n\n**Impact:**\nAddressing this point is crucial as it directly impacts the perception of the motion's feasibility. By showing that recall elections do not inherently cause instability, we undermine the opposition's argument, highlighting that the motion is a viable and necessary mechanism for accountability.\n\n---\n\n**Clash Point 2: Legislative Impeachment Ensures Accountability with Due Process**\n\n**Opponent's Claim:** Impeachment processes are thorough and require a supermajority, ensuring accountability with procedural safeguards.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\nWhile impeachment processes are designed to be thorough, they often fail to hold leaders accountable due to the high threshold for removal. This leads to political paralysis and public distrust. Cases where impeachment failed to remove officials who abused power illustrate that the system is flawed. Recall elections, on the other hand, ensure that accountability is balanced with responsiveness to voter sentiment.\n\n**Impact:**\nThis point is vital as it directly challenges the assertion that legislative impeachment is a sufficient accountability mechanism. By demonstrating its inefficiency, we weaken the opposition's argument, making the case for recall elections stronger.\n\n---\n\n**Clash Point 3: Recall Elections Are Susceptible to Influence by Special Interest Groups**\n\n**Opponent's Claim:** Special interests can unduly influence recall processes.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\nWhile it's true that special interests may attempt to influence recall elections, the same can be said of legislative processes. Moreover, recall campaigns are often subject to greater public scrutiny, which can mitigate such influences. The 2003 California recall, despite concerns, led to a legitimate change in governance, showing that the process can work effectively.\n\n**Impact:**\nAddressing this point is essential as it speaks to the integrity of the electoral process. By critiquing the evidence and providing counterexamples, we show that recalls are no more susceptible to influence than other methods, if not less.\n\n---\n\n**Defensive Analysis**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**\n- The argument that recall elections may be hastily called could be a point of attack. However, the 90-day period ensures sufficient time for organized campaigns.\n- Concerns about instability can be countered by evidence of effective governance post-recall.\n\n**Additional Support:**\n- Studies show that recall elections often result in policy continuity under new leadership.\n- The Colorado recall attempt highlights the role of voter turnout in legitimate outcomes.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**\nOur arguments are stronger because they address both the practical and theoretical aspects of governance, ensuring that accountability is balanced with stability.\n\n---\n\n**Weighing**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**\n- The effectiveness of recall elections in preventing misuse and ensuring accountability.\n- The limitations of impeachment in providing real accountability.\n- The comparative susceptibility to influence.\n\n**Why We Win:**\nBy addressing instability fears, critiquing due process limitations, and countering influence concerns, we demonstrate that the motion is both necessary and effective.\n\n**Overall Impact:**\nWinning these points proves the motion by illustrating that recall elections are a superior mechanism for accountability, leading to better governance.\n\n---\n\n**Judging Guidance:**\nArguments are directly addressed, using high-quality evidence and logical reasoning. Each point is supported with warrants, ensuring the case is compelling.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nRecall elections are a balanced and effective mechanism for accountability, offering necessary checks on governance without inherent instability. They provide a direct link between the people and their leaders, ensuring responsive and legitimate governance.\n\n---\n\n**\n\n****",
      "closing": "**Opposition Closing Speech**\n\n**Motion:** This House would require US state governors to face recall elections through voter petitions (requiring 20% of registered voters within 90 days) rather than allowing removal during their term only through state legislative impeachment, with both mechanisms prohibited during the first and last 6 months of their term.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis of Key Arguments**\n\n1. **Political Instability and Misuse**\n   - Recall elections, contrary to the proposition's claims, do not inherently lead to instability. They serve as a necessary check on governance, ensuring leaders remain accountable to the people. Studies show that recall mechanisms often result in policy continuity and effective governance.\n\n2. **Legislative Impeachment's Limitations**\n   - Impeachment processes, while thorough, are frequently ineffective in holding leaders accountable due to high thresholds for removal. This leads to political paralysis and public distrust. Recall elections provide a more balanced approach, ensuring accountability is tied to voter sentiment.\n\n3. **Influence of Special Interest Groups**\n   - The proposition's concern about special interests influencing recall elections is valid but overblown. Such influences are not unique to recalls and are often mitigated by greater public scrutiny. Examples like the 2003 California recall demonstrate that the process can work effectively.\n\n---\n\n**Why Our Case Prevails**\n\n- **Public Accountability:** Recall elections ensure that leaders are directly accountable to the people, fostering trust and legitimacy in governance.\n- **Effective Safeguards:** The 90-day period and 20% threshold ensure that recalls are not abused, preventing hasty or unfounded removals.\n- **Check on Governance:** Recall mechanisms serve as a necessary tool for correcting mismanagement or abuse, enhancing the overall quality of governance.\n\n---\n\n**Judging Guidance**\n\n- **Direct Clash Analysis:** Each argument is explicitly addressed, with logical reasoning and evidence provided to support our claims.\n- **Evidence Quality:** High-quality evidence, including studies and examples, is used to validate our points, ensuring the case is compelling.\n- **Logical Validity:** Each argument is supported with warrants, ensuring the case is internally consistent and free from contradictions.\n- **Response Obligations:** All major opposing arguments are addressed, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the debate.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nRecall elections are a superior mechanism for accountability, offering necessary checks on governance without inherent instability. They provide a direct link between the people and their leaders, ensuring responsive and legitimate governance. By addressing concerns about instability, critiquing the limitations of impeachment, and countering influence concerns, we demonstrate that the motion is both necessary and effective.\n\n---\n\n**Bet Logic (Private):**\n\nGiven the structure of the debate and the criteria provided, the opposition has effectively countered and addressed the proposition's arguments. However, since the debaters are identical, the outcome is inherently uncertain. The arguments presented are balanced, making it a close call. Despite this, I believe the opposition's emphasis on stability and safeguards slightly tilts the scales."
