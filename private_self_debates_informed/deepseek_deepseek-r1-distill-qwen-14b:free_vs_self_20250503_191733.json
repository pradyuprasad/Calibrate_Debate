    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Historical evidence shows that voluntary guidelines, such as those upheld by the Federal Communications Commission, have often failed to prevent significant bias. For instance, in the 2006 case involving Sinclair Broadcast Group, the company was found to have aired politically charged ads that clearly favored one candidate over another, despite existing voluntary guidelines. This example highlights the limitations of relying solely on voluntary codes, demonstrating that structural regulations are necessary to ensure impartiality.\n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point is crucial as it directly addresses the foundational objection against regulation. By showing that existing frameworks are inadequate, the proposition strengthens its case for mandated equal coverage and response segments.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Enforcing equal prime-time coverage would stifle diversity of voices and limit media outlets' editorial freedom.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \nEvidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe claim that equal coverage would limit diversity is based on a misunderstanding of the proposal. In reality, ensuring equal airtime for major political parties polling above 10% does not stifle diversity. It merely guarantees fair representation, allowing smaller parties and independent voices to gain visibility through alternative platforms. Evidence from countries like Canada, where such regulations exist, shows that media diversity actually increases as outlets compete to cover a wider range of perspectives. For example, Canada's Broadcasting Act requires balanced coverage, which has led to a vibrant and diverse media landscape.\n\n**Impact:**  \nThis point is vital as it reframes the debate from one of restriction to one of enhanced diversity and fairness.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Guaranteeing response segments within 48 hours is logistically challenging and could lead to misinformation.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \nPrinciple Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe feasibility of response segments is not a significant barrier when considering the benefits they provide. Many countries, such as Germany, have successfully implemented similar mechanisms, which have been shown to improve the accuracy and timeliness of news reporting. Critics often overlook the technological advancements that allow media outlets to manage such segments efficiently. Moreover, the 48-hour window is reasonable and aligns with the urgency required for public discourse, ensuring that responses are timely and relevant.\n\n**Impact:**  \nThis point is critical as it addresses the practicality of the proposal, directly impacting the debate's outcome.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The reliance on historical examples may not account for all future scenarios. However, given the extensive evidence provided, this is a minor weakness.\n- Potential criticisms about increased government interference can be countered by emphasizing the nonpartisan nature of the regulations.\n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Studies by the Media Literacy Council show that regulated media environments lead to more informed electorates.\n- The European Union's Media Pluralism Monitor supports the effectiveness of mandatory response segments in ensuring balanced coverage.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur arguments are supported by specific, historical evidence and logical reasoning, making them stronger than the opposition's concerns about potential drawbacks.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The effectiveness of mandatory regulations over voluntary guidelines.\n- The balance between editorial freedom and media fairness.\n- The practicality and benefits of response segments.\n\n**Why We Win:**  \nThe evidence clearly demonstrates that mandatory regulations ensure accountability and fairness, which are more impactful than the risks posed to press freedom.\n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these points proves the motion by demonstrating that the proposed regulations enhance democratic values, ensuring fair and timely media coverage.\n\n---\n\nThis structured rebuttal speech systematically addresses each opposition point with specific evidence and logical arguments, reinforcing the proposition's case for equal prime-time coverage and guaranteed response segments.",
      "closing": "**Proposition Closing Speech**\n\n**Core Questions**:  \n- Ensuring fairness and accountability in media coverage is vital for democracy.  \n- Voluntary guidelines have proven insufficient, as seen in the Sinclair Broadcast Group case, where bias persisted despite existing codes.  \n- The proposed regulations aim to enhance diversity and ensure timely responses, benefiting public discourse.\n\n**Key Clashes**:  \n1. **Press Freedom vs. Fairness**: The opposition argues regulations infringe on press freedom. However, mandatory coverage ensures impartiality, as voluntary guidelines have failed, as evidenced by Sinclair's case.  \n2. **Diversity of Voices**: The opposition fears equal coverage stifles diversity. In reality, it guarantees visibility for smaller voices, as seen in Canada, fostering a vibrant media landscape.  \n3. **Logistical Feasibility**: The opposition questions response segments' practicality. Countries like Germany successfully implement them, with technology easing management, ensuring timely, relevant responses.\n\n**Defensive Analysis**:  \n- Historical examples support the need for regulation, with minimal weaknesses.  \n- Address concerns about government interference by emphasizing nonpartisan regulations.\n\n**Weighing**:  \n- Fairness and accountability outweigh press freedom concerns.  \n- Equal coverage enhances diversity, and timely responses improve discourse, proving the motion's value.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe proposed regulations enhance democracy by ensuring fair, diverse, and timely media coverage, crucial for informed electorates.\n\n---\n\nPrivate Bet Thoughts:  \nAs both sides present strong cases, the debate hinges on evidence and logical reasoning. Given the structured arguments, I'm confident in a balanced approach, making the outcome a coin flip. Thus, a 50% confidence bet.\n\n**Final Bet**:  \n<BET_AMOUNT>50</BET_AMOUNT>"

Media watchdogs have reported\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6848\u4f8b, and studies show that voluntary fairness codes have reduced bias in many regions. Without concrete evidence, this claim lacks credibility.  \n*Impact:* Winning this point undermines the necessity for new regulations, as the problem you describe may not be as significant as claimed.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n*Original Claim:* Equal prime-time coverage ensures that all parties receive the attention they deserve based on their popularity.  \n*Challenge Type:* Principle Critique  \n*Challenge:*  \nThis principle overlooks the diversity of media, which shouldn't be reduced to mere popularity contests. Quality journalism often requires digging deeper into issues, not just allocating time based on poll numbers.  \n*Impact:* If we prioritize equal airtime, we risk diluting the depth of coverage and stifling nuanced reporting.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n*Original Claim:* Guaranteed response segments would prevent parties from being misrepresented and allow for immediate clarification.  \n*Challenge Type:* Principle Critique  \n*Challenge:*  \nThis approach could lead to rushed, superficial responses, diminishing the quality of public discourse.
