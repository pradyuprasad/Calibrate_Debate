    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "rebuttal": "<proposition_rebuttal>\n\n### **CLASH POINT 1**\n**Original Claim:** \"Governments must maintain a direct operational role in space to ensure national security and strategic interests.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition cites historical examples like the Apollo 11 mission and the Department of Defense's Space Force to argue for government direct operations. However, these examples show government dependency on private contractors, such as SpaceX, which handled significant portions of the Apollo program and now supports DoD operations. The evidence doesn't prove that direct government operation is necessary, as private companies are already integral to national security efforts.\n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point weakens the opposition's case by showing that national security can be maintained through partnerships,not direct control.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n**Original Claim:** \"The private sector lacks the capacity to independently regulate itself, requiring active government oversight.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition invokes the \"first-mover advantage\" to argue for oversight. However, this principle applies more to market competition than space regulation. The private sector's competitive nature inherently prevents monopolies. Historical evidence shows that regulatory bodies, not direct government control, have effectively managed industries like telecommunications without monopolistic outcomes.\n\n**Impact:**  \nThis challenges the need for continued direct government operation, emphasizing that regulation alone suffices.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n**Original Claim:** \"Direct government involvement in space ensures the pursuit of high-risk, high-reward research that private companies are unlikely to undertake.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence\n\n**Challenge:**  \nPrivate companies do pursue high-risk projects. For example, Blue Origin and SpaceX invest in lunar and Mars missions, indicating willingness to take on significant challenges. Government funding should focus on complementary areas rather than duplicating efforts.\n\n**Impact:**  \nThis counters the notion that private entities shy away from such research, questioning the need for government-led projects.\n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The rebuttal assumes private companies can handle national security, which may be contestable.  \n- The reliance on historical examples might limit the argument's future applicability.\n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Private sector agility often surpasses government processes, as seen in rapid space tech advancements.  \n- Regulation ensures accountability without direct control, maintaining public interest.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nThe proposition's approach balances innovation, cost-efficiency, and strategic focus, offering a sustainable model for space exploration.\n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. National security can be maintained through private partnerships.  \n2. Effective regulation prevents monopolies.  \n3. Private entities pursue high-risk research, reducing the need for direct government involvement.\n\n**Why We Win:**  \nThese points highlight the efficiency and capability of private sectors, making government regulation a superior approach.\n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nTransitioning to regulation fosters innovation, reduces costs, and allows strategic focus, proving the motion.\n\n</proposition_rebuttal>\n\n",
      "closing": "### **CLOSING SPEECH**\n\n---\n\n### **FRAMING**\nThe debate has centered on whether governments should transition their primary role in space from direct operation to regulation and oversight of private sector activities. The core issues are clear:  \n- **Efficiency and innovation:** Can the private sector achieve objectives faster and more effectively?  \n- **National security and strategic interests:** Can these be safeguarded through regulation, or does direct government control remain essential?  \n- **Public goods and high-risk research:** Should governments focus on these areas, or can the private sector take the lead?  \n\nThe evidence and arguments presented demonstrate that transitioning to regulation is not only feasible but also the most forward-looking approach for space exploration.\n\n---\n\n### **KEY CLASHES**\n\n#### **1. Efficiency and Innovation**  \nThe opposition claims that governments must maintain direct operations for national security, citing historical examples like the Apollo program and the Department of Defense\u2019s Space Force. However, these examples reveal that private companies like SpaceX are already integral to national security efforts. The evidence does not prove that direct government control is necessary, as partnerships with private firms have been critical to achieving milestones like landing rockets and supporting military operations.  \n\nThis clash matters because it directly impacts whether we can transition to a more efficient model. By relying on partnerships, governments can maintain national security while fostering innovation. The private sector\u2019s agility and cost-effectiveness are superior, as seen in SpaceX\u2019s rapid advancements without compromising public interests.\n\n#### **2. National Security and Strategic Interests**  \nThe opposition argues that the private sector lacks the capacity to independently regulate itself. While regulation is necessary, the evidence demonstrates that private companies are capable of adhering to guidelines when enforced by robust regulatory frameworks. The private sector\u2019s competitive nature inherently prevents monopolistic tendencies, as seen in industries like telecommunications.  \n\nThis clash is crucial because it determines whether direct government control is necessary. Effective regulation, not direct operation, is sufficient to ensure a fair and sustainable space environment. The private sector\u2019s ability to innovate and compete under regulation outweighs the need for continued direct oversight.\n\n#### **3. High-Risk Research and Public Goods**  \nThe opposition asserts that only government-led initiatives can pursue high-risk, high-reward research. However, private companies like Blue Origin and SpaceX are already investing in ambitious projects such as lunar and Mars missions. While government funding should complement these efforts, the idea that private entities shun high-risk projects is outdated.  \n\nThis clash matters because it shapes our understanding of the role of government in space. While governments should focus on strategic areas, the private sector\u2019s willingness to take on significant challenges reduces the need for direct government involvement in all aspects of space exploration.\n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**\n\n#### **Priority Analysis**  \nThe most critical clash is over efficiency and innovation. Transitioning to regulation enhances productivity, reduces costs, and fosters a competitive environment that drives progress. Without addressing this, the debate risks overlooking the transformative potential of private sector involvement.  \n\n#### **Case Proof**  \nWinning the efficiency argument proves that the transition is not only beneficial but necessary for space exploration. By focusing on strategic areas like high-risk R&D, governments can achieve greater impact without direct control.  \n\n#### **Final Weighing**  \nAny losses on secondary issues, such as national security, do not undermine the overall case. The benefits of transitioning to regulation\u2014greater\u521b\u65b0, cost savings, and strategic focus\u2014are too significant to ignore. The opposition\u2019s arguments, while valid in certain contexts, fail to account for the private sector\u2019s capabilities and the importance of shifting government roles.\n\n---\n\n### **CONCLUSION**\n\nThe evidence and arguments presented conclusively demonstrate that transitioning to regulation is the most effective approach for governments in space. This model enhances innovation, reduces financial strain, and allows governments to focus on strategic priorities. By addressing concerns about national security and public goods, the motion ensures a safer, more equitable, and forward-looking future for space exploration.  \n\nThe opposition\u2019s arguments, while raising valid points, ultimately fail to counter the superior efficiency and innovation-driven approach of transitioning to regulation. Vote for the motion.\n\n---\n\n"

      "opening": "<opening_speech>\n\nSTRUCTURE: OPENING SPEECH  \nTOPIC: Opposition Side  \n\n---\n\n### **ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:**  \nGovernments must maintain a direct operational role in space to ensure national security and strategic interests.  \n\n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- **Example 1:** The U.S. government\u2019s direct involvement in space operations during the Cold War, such as the Apollo 11 mission in 1969, ensured national superiority and prevented adversaries from gaining technological dominance.  \n- **Example 2:** In 2023, the Department of Defense\u2019s Space Force operates critical satellites for navigation, communication, and early warning systems, which are essential for national security.  \n- **Example 3:** China\u2019s government-led space program, including the 2020 Chang\u2019e 5 lunar mission, demonstrates how direct operations advance national power and compete on the global stage.  \n\n**Connection:**  \nThese examples show that government-operated space programs are essential for maintaining national security, preventing external threats, and ensuring strategic autonomy. Without direct operations, reliance on private companies could expose vulnerabilities to foreign espionage or economic coercion.  \n\n---\n\n### **ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:**  \nThe private sector lacks the capacity to independently regulate itself, requiring active government oversight.  \n\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- **Key Principle:** The concept of \u201cfirst-mover advantage\u201d in industries often leads to monopolistic tendencies, where private companies prioritize profit over public interest.  \n- **Application:** Without robust government regulation, private space companies like SpaceX could dominate orbital traffic management, creating monopolies that stifle competition and harm innovation.  \n- **Relevance:** This principle is critical in space, where the absence of regulation could lead to resource depletion, pollution, and unsafe practices in Earth\u2019s orbit.  \n\n**Connection:**  \nThis principle proves that government oversight is necessary to prevent the private sector from exploiting vulnerabilities and ensuring a fair, competitive, and sustainable space environment.  \n\n---\n\n### **ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:**  \nDirect government involvement in space ensures the pursuit of high-risk, high-reward research that private companies are unlikely to undertake.  \n\n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- **Example 1:** The James Webb Space Telescope, developed by NASA, required $10 billion in government funding and addressed complex scientific questions that private companies would avoid due to financial risks.  \n- **Example 2:** DARPA\u2019s role in developing GPS technology, initially seen as a risky endeavor, has transformed modern society but would never have been prioritized by private investors.  \n- **Example 3:** The discovery of water on the Moon by NASA missions, such as Artemis, is a high-risk endeavor that could unlock new possibilities for human settlement but is unlikely to be pursued by profit-driven private firms.  \n\n**Connection:**  \nThese examples demonstrate that only government-led initiatives can tackle ambitious, long-term projects with societal impact, ensuring humanity\u2019s progress in space.  \n\n---\n\n### **SYNTHESIS**  \nMy arguments collectively establish why governments must retain a direct operational role in space:  \n1. **National Security:** Direct operations safeguard national interests from foreign threats.  \n2. **Regulation:** Oversight prevents monopolistic practices and ensures a fair and sustainable space environment.  \n3. **Innovation:** Government-led initiatives pursue high-risk, high-reward projects that private companies avoid.  \n\nThese points prove that transitioning to a regulatory role alone would undermine national security, stifle innovation, and allow private interests to dominate space activities at the expense of public welfare. The immediate impact of maintaining government operations is a safer, more equitable, and forward-looking space future.  \n\n---\n\n</opening_speech>  \n\n",
      "rebuttal": "<rebuttal_speech>\n\n### **CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:** Transitioning to regulation enhances efficiency and innovation in space exploration.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:** The proposition cites SpaceX's achievements, such as landing the first rocket in 2015, as evidence of superior efficiency. However, this example overlooks the significant government contracts and subsidies that funded SpaceX's development. The evidence does not adequately demonstrate that private sector efficiency can entirely replace government operations without relying on public support. Additionally, the proposition's claim that the private sector fosters innovation is partially true but fails to address the reliance on initial government funding and infrastructure.\n\n**Impact:** Recognizing the necessity of government support in private sector achievements is crucial. Without acknowledging this dependency, the proposition understates the ongoing role governments must play to sustain innovation.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:** The private sector's cost-effectiveness reduces financial strain on governments.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:** The proposition assumes private sector cost-effectiveness inherently benefits governments, but this overlooks the short-term profit-driven focus of private companies. For example, while SpaceX's Starship development is cheaper than NASA's programs, it may not invest in long-term, high-risk projects. The principle of cost-effectiveness is context-dependent and does not capture the broader fiscal implications for governments.\n\n**Impact:** Ignoring the fiscal risks associated with private sector short-termism can lead to underestimating future costs and economic instability.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:** Regulation allows governments to focus on strategic areas like high-risk R&D.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle\n\n**Challenge:** While the proposition suggests regulation is superior, maintaining a direct operational role ensures better alignment with public interests. Unlike the private sector, governments can fund and prioritize public goods, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, which addresses societal questions rather than market demands. This counters the proposition's argument by presenting a principle where direct involvement is more appropriate.\n\n**Impact:** Without direct government involvement, crucial public research and development may be deprioritized in favor of profitable ventures.\n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- Over-reliance on historical examples may not account for future private sector adaptability.  \n- The proposition may argue that government regulation inherently safeguards national interests, but this requires clearer evidence of how regulation can match the operational vigilance.\n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Highlight the enduring need for government oversight to balance private interests with public welfare.  \n- Emphasize how direct operations ensure continuity in national security and strategic autonomy.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our focus on national security and strategic interests underscores the necessity of continued government involvement.  \n- By addressing both the potential of the private sector and the risks of over-reliance, we offer a balanced perspective that the proposition fails to achieve.\n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The necessity of government oversight for national security is paramount.  \n- The role of regulation in balancing private interests and public welfare must not be understated.\n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- Our arguments emphasize the fundamental importance of government operations, which the proposition undervalues.  \n- By addressing both efficiency and strategic needs, we provide a more comprehensive framework for space activities.\n\n**Overall Impact:**  \n- Winning on national security and strategic interests ensures a safer, more equitable space future.  \n- Transitioning to regulation alone overlooks critical public responsibilities, diminishing the broader societal benefits of space exploration.\n\n</rebuttal_speech>\n\n",

The arguments are structured to clash with the proposition by highlighting the necessity of government operations for security, regulation, and innovation.

However, based on the arguments presented and the judging criteria, the proposition side has effectively addressed the opposition's concerns and provided strong evidence for transitioning to regulation. The opposition's arguments, while valid, do not outweigh the proposition's case. Given the structure and depth of the proposition's rebuttals, I am confident that the judge will side with the proposition."

      "thoughts": "In this debate, while the proposition presents valid points about the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the private sector, the opposition's arguments regarding national security and the necessity of government oversight hold significant weight. The examples provided, such as the Apollo mission and the Department of Defense's Space Force, illustrate the critical role governments play in safeguarding national interests and pursuing long-term, high-risk research. These elements are foundational to ensuring a secure and equitable future in space exploration. Although the proposition counters with examples of private sector achievements, the proposition overlooks the enduring need for government oversight to align private interests with public welfare. Consequently, the opposition's emphasis on national security and strategic interests is paramount, making it a persuasive case for maintaining direct government operations."
