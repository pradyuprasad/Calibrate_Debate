    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "rebuttal": "```xml\n\n\n```\n\n---\n\n**Rebuttal Speech**\n\n**Motion:** This House believes that governments should transition their primary role in space from direct operation to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities.\n\n**Speaker:** Opposition\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n*The Apollo 11 mission in 1969, led by NASA, was pivotal in achieving the first human landing on the Moon. The Space Shuttle program, operational from 1981 to 2011, demonstrated reusable spacecraft capabilities. The International Space Station (ISS), a collaborative project since 1998, relies on government funding and coordination.*\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n**Counter Evidence**\n\n**Challenge:**  \nWhile it's true that government-led projects like Apollo 11 and the ISS have been significant, recent advancements by the private sector demonstrate their capability to drive innovation and efficiency. For example, companies like SpaceX have reduced launch costs by a factor of 10, achieved milestones such as the first private spacecraft docking with the ISS, and even reused rockets, which was once deemed too complex for the private sector. These achievements show that private companies can undertake ambitious projects without relying on direct government operations, making the government's continued role less necessary for exploration.\n\n**Impact:**  \nThis point is crucial because it challenges the notion that government leadership is the only way to achieve ambitious space goals. By highlighting private sector successes, it demonstrates that transitioning to regulation could actually accelerate progress by leveraging market-driven innovation.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n*Transitioning to private sector regulation could lead to prioritization of profit over high-risk, high-reward projects.*\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n**Evidence Critique**\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition cites Mars One as an example of private sector failure. However, this critique is flawed because Mars One was not a traditional private company but a non-profit with unrealistic goals. In contrast, established private companies like Blue Origin and SpaceX are making significant investments in high-risk projects like reusable rockets and Mars colonization. Additionally, government projects like the Constellation program were canceled due to cost overruns and political shifts, showing that government-led projects are not immune to prioritizing budgets over risks. \n\n**Impact:**  \nThis is important because it counters the simplistic view that only government can manage risk. The private sector can and does pursue high-risk projects, and market competition often drives more efficient solutions than government monopolies.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n*Government control over critical space technologies is essential for national security.*\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \n**Principle Critique**\n\n**Challenge:**  \nWhile national security is indeed vital, the proposition's principle of complete government control is too broad. The rapid pace of technological advancement in the private sector means that government control can stifle innovation and create bureaucratic delays. For instance, the GPS system was initially government-controlled but was later opened to private use, leading to improvements and wider accessibility without compromising security. A balanced approach where the government regulates while allowing private innovation can better protect national interests.\n\n**Impact:**  \nThis point is critical because it questions the assumption that government control is the only way to ensure security. By advocating for a regulatory role, we can maintain security while fostering innovation.\n\n---\n\n### **SYNTHESIS**\n\nMy arguments collectively show that while government oversight is necessary, transitioning to a regulatory role can actually enhance space exploration, risk management, and national security. The private sector's demonstrated ability to innovate and execute complex projects suggests that continued direct government operations are unnecessary. This transition would not only accelerate progress but also ensure that national interests are safeguarded through strategic regulation.\n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The proposition may argue that private companies are motivated by profit and might neglect public good projects. \n- They could also challenge the efficiency of the private sector by pointing out past failures.\n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Studies show that mixed models of government regulation and private sector operation yield better results than either approach alone. For example, the commercial crew program with NASA and private companies has been successful in reducing costs and increasing competition.\n- The Department of Defense already works closely with private companies for defense technologies, proving that collaboration can protect national security.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur evidence directly compares the strengths of private versus government operations, showing that the balance advocated by our motion is more effective and innovative.\n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The importance of private sector innovation versus government tradition.\n- The efficiency of mixed models versus government-only approaches.\n- The ability of regulation to balance public and private interests.\n\n**Why We Win:**  \nOur motion is supported by stronger evidence of private sector success and the flawed assumptions in the proposition's arguments. By transitioning to a regulatory role, governments can ensure sustainable growth and innovation in space.\n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these points proves that the motion is viable and beneficial, as it aligns with the principles of progress and innovation while maintaining necessary security and oversight.\n\n---\n\n**CONFIDENCE BET:**  \n",
      "closing": "**Opposition Closing Speech**\n\n**Motion:** This House believes that governments should transition their primary role in space from direct operation to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities.\n\n**Speaker:** Opposition\n\n---\n\n#### **FRAMING**\n\nThe debate has hinged on whether governments should shift from direct operations to regulation in space. I will now summarize my case and address the proposition's arguments to demonstrate why continued government direct involvement is essential.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Core Question:** Should we rely on historical government achievements in space exploration?\n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \nThe Apollo 11 mission and the ISS exemplify how government leadership has achieved unprecedented feats, fostering international collaboration and driving technological breakthroughs. These projects required visionary leadership and significant public investment, which cannot always be replicated by the private sector.\n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe proposition downplays historical successes, arguing that the environment has changed. However, they fail to consider that many private sector achievements, like SpaceX's cost reductions, were built on government foundational research. Without initial public investments, such as those in NASA, the private sector wouldn't have had the same starting point.\n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nMaintaining government direct operations ensures continuity in ambitious projects and prevents monopolization by private interests, safeguarding public benefit.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Core Question:** Does the private sector prioritize high-risk, high-reward projects effectively?\n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \nWhile companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are innovative, they often focus on profitable ventures. Mars One's failure is a cautionary tale of private sector overreach without oversight. Government oversight is crucial to balance commercial interests with broader societal goals.\n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe proposition dismisses Mars One as a non-profit but overlooks systemic issues in private initiatives. Government projects, despite challenges, are more accountable and aligned with public interests.\n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWithout government oversight, critical space exploration risks being sidelined in favor of profitable ventures, hindering collective progress.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Core Question:** Is government control essential for national security, or can regulation suffice?\n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \nThe GPS system's privatization led to improvements but also introduced vulnerabilities. Government control ensures critical technologies are developed with national security in mind, preventing private interests from compromising sensitive infrastructure.\n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe proposition assumes that regulation alone can protect national security, ignoring the risks of dependency on private companies. The Department of Defense's work shows that direct control is necessary for strategic interests.\n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nTransitioning to regulation may expose critical technologies to market-driven priorities, jeopardizing national security.\n\n---\n\n### **SYNTHESIS**\n\nMy arguments demonstrate that government direct operations are vital for maintaining:\n1. **Exploration Leadership:** Ensuring ambitious projects are pursued for public good.\n2. **Risk Management:** Balancing commercial interests with societal needs.\n3. **National Security:** Protecting critical technologies from private sector prioritization.\n\nTransitioning entirely to regulation risks abandoning these essential roles.\n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \nExploration and security are paramount. Without strong government leadership, progress could stall, and national interests could be compromised.\n\n**Case Proof:**  \nMy arguments directly support the need for government retention, proving that transitioning is premature and risky.\n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nThe proposition's selective focus on private successes ignores broader risks. Our comprehensive case, supported by historical evidence and logical reasoning, outweighs theirs.\n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \nThe proposition may argue that private efficiency surpasses government effectiveness, but accountability and strategic focus are often lacking in private ventures.\n\n**Additional Support:**  \nGovernment oversight has historically proven necessary for long-term, large-scale projects. Continued direct operations ensure sustainability and adaptability.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur evidence demonstrates that government leadership is indispensable for exploration, risk management, and security, making our case stronger.\n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- Government historical achievements vs. private sector capabilities.\n- High-risk project prioritization.\n- National security concerns.\n\n**Why We Win:**  \nOur evidence highlights the necessity of government leadership, countering the proposition's superficial focus on private innovation. This case ensures sustainable space progress aligned with public interests.\n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these points proves that government direct operations are essential for continued progress and security. Transitioning to regulation prematurely risks undermining these objectives.\n\n---\n\n**Bet Amount:**  \n\n\n**Bet Logic:**  \n"

      "thoughts": "The motion presents a compelling case for transitioning government roles to regulation, supported by specific examples like SpaceX reducing launch costs and NASA's Commercial Crew Program. These points are strong and directly tied to efficiency and security. However, the opponent can counter with the importance of government oversight in strategic missions, which I concede but argue is balanced by the benefits of private innovation. The evidence used is high quality, and the logical structure supports a transition, thus leading me to a moderate confidence."

My opening speech argues against this by highlighting the necessity of government leadership in exploration, the risks involved in private sector dominance, and the importance of national security. Each argument uses specific historical evidence and logical connections, making a strong case for continued government involvement. While I believe the arguments are robust, acknowledging the proposition's potential strengths, I am confident but cautious."
