    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "Here is the opening speech for the proposition side of the motion: \"This House would require US state governors to face recall elections through voter petitions (requiring 20% of registered voters within 90 days) rather than allowing removal during their term only through state legislative impeachment, with both mechanisms prohibited during the first and last 6 months of their term.\"\n\n**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: Recall elections empower citizens and increase government accountability.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n- Explain the key principle/framework: The fundamental principle of a democratic government is that the power resides in the people. Elected officials are entrusted with that power and should be directly accountable to their constituents. Recall elections, triggered by voter petitions, offer a direct mechanism for holding governors accountable between regularly scheduled elections. Impeachment, on the other hand, is a political process that is often influenced by partisan considerations and may not accurately reflect the broader will of the electorate.\n- Show why it is valid/important: Direct accountability mechanisms are crucial for preventing abuse of power and ensuring that elected officials remain responsive to the needs and desires of the people they represent. Without the threat of recall, governors may be tempted to pursue policies that are unpopular or that violate the public trust, knowing that they are insulated from immediate consequences. Such a system will make governors more responsive and thoughtful in their policymaking.\n- Demonstrate how it applies here: Transitioning from impeachment to recall provides a system whereby the public can directly challenge the power of governors by way of petition. Requiring 20% voter signatures ensures reasonable thresholds for petitions that reflect significant lack of trust among the governor's constituents.\n\nConnection: Recall elections address the shortcomings of relying solely on legislative impeachment by empowering citizens to hold their executives accountable, thus strengthening democratic principles of self-governance.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: Recall elections can act as a necessary check on executive overreach and prevent potential corruption.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n- For Evidence: Consider the case of Gray Davis, the former governor of California, who was successfully recalled in 2003. Davis was impeached due to various poor decisions during his term, primarily arising from the California energy crisis. In such instances the citizens were able to remove the governor and elect a new governor.\n- Include real world cases and outcomes: The presence of a recall mechanism acts as a constant deterrent of corruption. Impeachment trails are generally time consuming and costly, which would require legislative work to be tied up on a singular case and is generally a lengthy process, that in some instances can allow the governors to exploit loop holes in regulations to achieve power over citizens\n- Show clear relevance to the topic: Impeachments are also more likely than recalls to be marred by partisanship and can lead to prolonged periods of political instability and divide. A recall can take place more easily because it is based on concrete evidence or lack of.\n\nConnection: The real-world case of Gray Davis demonstrates how citizens can effectively use recall elections to remove governors who have lost the public's trust, acting as a crucial check on executive power.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\nOur arguments work together to demonstrate why replacing impeachment with recall elections, triggered by voter petitions, is a desirable policy. First, recall elections provide a more direct and democratic mechanism for holding governors accountable than legislative impeachment. This fulfills the fundamental principle of government by the people. Second, the historical example of Gray Davis shows the real-world effectiveness of recall elections in preventing executive overreach and corruption. These arguments converge to highlight the need for a system that empowers citizens, promotes transparency, and discourages abuse of power. By implementing this policy, we can strengthen democratic governance and ensure that governors remain accountable to the people they serve.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "CLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: Recall elections initiated by voter petitions undermine governmental stability and efficient policy-making.\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge: The principle that government stability trumps accountability is flawed. While stability is desirable, it cannot come at the cost of allowing governors to act unchecked and unaccountable. The opposition claims a constant threat of recall creates short-term focus, but that threat actually *incentivizes* governors to listen to their constituents and address their concerns proactively. A governor truly acting in the best interests of their state has little to fear from a recall. Furthermore, the 20% signature threshold provides a significant hurdle, preventing frivolous recalls driven by small minorities. It is not a constant threat of constant recalls.\nImpact: If we concede that stability is the *only* thing that matters, then we can justify authoritarianism. By prioritizing accountability through recall elections, we ensure government serves the people, not the other way around. This promotes a healthier, more responsive democracy. So focusing on the principle of stability is not the only way that the system is meant to work.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: Voter petition-based recall elections are susceptible to partisan manipulation and abuse.\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: The opposition points to the 2003 Gray Davis recall as an example of partisan manipulation. We acknowledge that partisanship *can* play a role, but that does not invalidate the entire process. The Davis recall occurred because he demonstrably failed to address the California energy crisis, a failure that impacted millions of citizens. Furthermore, the existence of *attempted* but unsuccessful recalls, like that of Newsom in 2021, demonstrates that the 20% threshold is *not* negligible. It provides a check on purely partisan efforts. Crucially, the burden of proof that a governor's actions are detrimental to the state lies with the people, making it harder for partisan groups to trigger recalls. The oppositions claim that the initiative removes Davis cost the state millions, this is not attributed to anything, and seems to be baseless\nImpact: The risk of *some* partisan influence cannot outweigh the benefit of a system that allows citizens to remove demonstrably unfit governors. A governor can fail at governance and still be politically aligned to others, which is not necessarily a position that citizens share. The impeachment, furthermore is a political tool, which would also lend itself to partisan manipulation. We must have trust in the people.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: Legislative impeachment offers a more deliberative and reasoned approach to removing a governor from office.\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The opposition argues that legislative impeachment provides a higher standard of evidence and due process. However, impeachment is inherently a *political* process. Legislators are subject to party pressure, political calculations, and biases that can undermine their objectivity. Furthermore, impeachment can be a lengthy and divisive process, dragging on for months or even years, paralyzing the state government. The principle behind legislative process might be flawed given the factors that affect lawmakers decisions.\nImpact: Relying *solely* on impeachment leaves the power to remove a governor in the hands of politicians, not the people. This undermines the fundamental principle of self-governance. While impeachment may be appropriate in certain circumstances, it should not be the *only* recourse for holding governors accountable.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- The opposition will likely continue to attack the potential for frivolous recalls driven by partisanship.\n- They will likely still state that the California example is isolated and not generalisable\n- They may reiterate that stability trumps quick change, despite changes not always being negative.\nAdditional Support:\n- To counter the partisanship claim, emphasize the 20% signature threshold.\n- Provide reinforcing evidence from other states with recall elections, demonstrating that they are not automatically destabilizing.\n- Highlight the increased responsiveness of governors in states with recall laws. This is something I had not though of and would be strong.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Recall elections provide a crucial check on executive power, ensuring that governors are accountable to the people they serve.\n- While acknowledging the potential for partisan influence, the 20% signature threshold and burden of proof on the petitioners mitigates this risk.\n- Impeachment is a political process that is not always the most effective or democratic means of removing a governor.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The primary disagreement centers on the balance between government stability and citizen accountability.\n- A secondary disagreement revolves around the role of partisanship in recall elections.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win because we prioritize citizen empowerment and government accountability. A governor that represents the needs of the population, will not garner 20% of peoples' approval for a recall.\n- The opposition's focus on stability comes at the cost of responsiveness and can lead to unchecked executive power.\nOverall Impact:\n- By implementing recall elections, we strengthen democratic governance and ensure that governors remain accountable to the people they serve.\n- The opposition's arguments amount to a defense of the status quo, which is a system that is less responsive to citizens' needs than the proposal.\n\n",
      "closing": "Okay, it's time to close this debate and bring home the win for the proposition. We've consistently demonstrated that empowering citizens with recall elections is a vital step towards accountable and responsive governance. Let's break down why you should vote with us.\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nCore Questions:\n- Is government stability more important than government accountability?\n- Who should hold the ultimate power to check executive overreach: the people or politicians?\n- Which mechanism, recall or impeachment, is less susceptible to political manipulation?\n\nKey Decisions: The core decision is whether we prioritize empowering citizens to directly hold their governors accountable, or prioritize stability at the potential cost of responsiveness. We must also decide which accountability mechanism, recall or impeachment, is more democratic and less prone to partisan bias.\n\nFrame: This debate isn't about whether recalls are *perfect*. It's about whether empowering voters with a direct check on executive power is *better* than relying solely on a political process (impeachment) that often serves partisan interests.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**CLASH 1**\nQuote: \"Recall elections initiated by voter petitions undermine governmental stability and efficient policy-making.\" vs \"The principle that government stability trumps accountability is flawed.\"\nOur Case Strength: We directly challenged the notion that stability is the *primary* concern. We highlighted that stability without accountability can lead to unchecked executive power. A 20% signature threshold is in fact, a middle ground that can reflect an amount of reasonable dissent that will allow the accountability to still exist, despite a possible instability. We also posited that a governor acting in the best interests of their constituents has nothing to fear from the recall.\nTheir Response Gaps: They failed to adequately address the risk of unchecked executive power in a system relying solely on impeachment. They also failed to explain precisely *how* the 20% threshold automatically leads to constant instability, especially given examples where recalls *failed*.\nCrucial Impact: This clash is paramount. It defines the core principle of this debate: Should we prioritize stability above all else, even if it means allowing a governor to act with less concern for the will of the people? Winning this point means we establish that accountability is *essential*, and that the 20% threshold provides a reasonable balance.\n\n**CLASH 2**\nQuote: \"Voter petition-based recall elections are susceptible to partisan manipulation and abuse.\" vs \"The opposition points to the 2003 Gray Davis recall as an example of partisan manipulation. We acknowledge that partisanship *can* play a role, but that does not invalidate the entire process.\"\nOur Case Strength: We acknowledged the potential for partisanship but emphasized that it doesn't invalidate the entire process. We highlighted the Gray Davis case as a *demonstrable* example of a governor failing to address a crisis, impacting millions. We provided some reason for why the people voted the way they did. The failed Newsom recall proves the 20% threshold is *not* easily overcome by purely partisan efforts. I did fail to generalise away from this evidence however.\nTheir Response Gaps: They only focused on Gray Davis as an example and did not try to argue against my point of the Newsom case. They also failed to engage with the argument that the impeachment is also a political tool that leads itself to partisan manipulation.\nCrucial Impact: The opposition wants you to believe that recalls are inherently driven by partisan agendas. We've shown that real failures of governance can trigger recalls, and that the 20% threshold is a real check. The important aspect is that the public has the 'burden of proof' here and that even with political manipulation, without a failure to govern, the recall cannot be successful.\n\n**CLASH 3**\nQuote: \"Legislative impeachment offers a more deliberative and reasoned approach to removing a governor from office.\" vs \"The opposition argues that legislative impeachment provides a higher standard of evidence and due process. However, impeachment is inherently a *political* process.\"\nOur Case Strength: We demonstrated that impeachment, while deliberative, is inherently *political*. Legislators are subject to party pressure and biases that undermine objectivity. Impeachment can be a prolonged, paralyzing process.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition didn't offer a real counter to the fact that party politics are an enormous factor in decision making. States can have political incentives to remove a governor and it can serve their interests to launch very politically motivated attacks. The impeachment process lacks the robustness required.\nCrucial Impact: This clash shows the fundamental weakness of relying *solely* on impeachment. It leaves the power to remove a governor in the hands of *politicians*, not the people. This undermines the principle of self-governance.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\nPriority Analysis:\n- The most important clash is the balance between stability and accountability. Accountability *must* take precedence.\n- The second most important question is who should hold the power to check executive overreach: the people or politicians? The people!\n\nCase Proof:\n- Winning the stability/accountability clash proves our case. Prioritizing accountability ensures a more responsive and democratic government.\n- Winning the \"who holds the power\" clash reinforces the principle of self-governance. People are in control, therefore empowering people is necessary.\n- Demonstrating the flaws in the impeachment process proves that recall serves as a necessary check.\n\nFinal Weighing:\n- The opposition's arguments are based on fear: fear of instability, fear of partisan manipulation.\n- We acknowledge these risks but demonstrate that they are manageable, and that the benefits of increased accountability outweigh them.\n- A vote for the proposition is a vote for empowering citizens, promoting transparency, and ensuring that governors remain accountable to the people they serve.\n\n"

      "opening": "Here is my opening speech arguing against the motion: \"This House would require US state governors to face recall elections through voter petitions (requiring 20% of registered voters within 90 days) rather than allowing removal during their term only through state legislative impeachment, with both mechanisms prohibited during the first and last 6 months of their term.\"\n\nOPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Recall elections initiated by voter petitions undermine governmental stability and efficient policy-making.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - Explain the key principle/framework: Elected officials need a reasonable period of stability to implement their platforms and govern effectively. Constant threat of recall creates short-term focus and pandering to public opinion rather than strategic planning. It is predicated that states have impeachment processes in general, signalling that some instances do warrant a governor to be removed, but that those processes exist in the appropriate bodies (e.g. legislative).\n  - Show why it is valid/important: A stable government is vital for economic growth, social programs, and consistent application of laws. Constant political turmoil discourages investment and makes long-term policy reforms impossible, because if governors will be potentially removed constantly, other parties would simply wait until a different individual gets elected.\n  - Demonstrate how it applies here: Requiring recall elections via voter petitions (20% within 90 days) subjects governors to volatile swings in public sentiment and organized pressure campaigns. This forces them to prioritize short-term popularity over sound governance. Governors will focus on small immediate policies to avoid the risk of recall, even at the expense of more important and impactful initiatives. This has the knock-on effect of incentivising smaller policies. As the policies would be small, a lot more of them have to be made to achieve a similar level of impact, thus creating an increase workload and decreasing quality of each policy.\nConnection: Frequent recall elections reduce the governor's ability to govern effectively, leading to unstable policies with less impact in the grand scheme of things due to short term focus to the populace.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: Voter petition-based recall elections are susceptible to partisan manipulation and abuse.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - For Evidence:\n  - Provide specific examples with dates/numbers: The 2003 California recall election against Governor Gray Davis, while ultimately successful, was fueled by partisan anger over energy policy and a struggling economy. While those frustrations held weight, this was an example of a political opponent capitalizing on Davis' unpopularity. The initiative to remove Davis cost the state millions and ultimately replaced him with Arnold Schwarzenegger. A similar recall was attempted in 2021 against current California Governor Newsom, but was unsuccessful.\n  - Include real world cases and outcomes: States implementing lower thresholds for ballot initiatives frequently see increased political spending and attempts at manipulation. The cost of these campaigns can overwhelm smaller organizations or grassroots movement.\n  - Show clear relevance to the topic: The proposed system, requiring only 20% of signatures within 90 days, creates an easy pathway for well-funded partisan groups to trigger recalls based on transient issues or to hamstring political opponents with nuisance elections. We acknowledge that this exists in impeachment processes, however the barrier for entry is much more challenging by having it be done through the legislation branch.\nConnection: A lower signature requirement for recall petitions incentivizes partisan groups to trigger elections based on short-term or manufactured issues, undermining the democratic process and costing taxpayers money.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: Legislative impeachment offers a more deliberative and reasoned approach to removing a governor from office.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - Explain the key principle/framework: Impeachment proceedings require a high standard of evidence and due process. Legislatures are designed to weigh evidence carefully, consider constitutional principles, and act with a more measured approach than a simple majority of voters reacting to a temporary crisis.\n  - Show why it is valid/important: Impeachment processes are designed to protect against frivolous or politically motivated attempts to remove an elected official. They provide a necessary safeguard against abuse of power while also ensuring accountability for serious malfeasance. Compared to the voter petition the process of going through legislative process of impeachment is much longer and has more levels of screening. This will lead to a higher degree of acceptance, and less push back\n  - Demonstrate how it applies here: The legislative impeachment process, while imperfect, provides a higher barrier to entry for removal of a sitting governor. This increases the stability of the office, while not completely absolving the governor of any political responsibility\nConnection: Impeachment offers a more structured and less easily manipulated method for holding governors accountable, protecting against the instability and partisan abuse inherent in frequent recall elections through voter petitions.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nOur arguments work together to demonstrate that replacing legislative impeachment with voter petition recall elections would destabilize state governments, invite partisan manipulation, and undermine sound governance. A constantly threatened governor will focus on short-term popular policies rather than long-term effective ones. The ease with which recalls could be triggered using voter petitions will lead to frivolous and politically motivated campaigns, costing taxpayers money and diverting attention from critical issues. Impeachment, while not perfect, offers a more deliberative and rigorous approach, protecting against both abuse of power and the chaos of constant political upheaval. By upholding the current impeachment framework, we prioritize governmental stability, reasoned decision-making, and the ability of elected officials to effectively serve their constituents. We avoid the pitfall of constant elections, that can be potentially triggered with low evidence.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "CLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: Recall elections empower citizens and increase government accountability.\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge: While the principle of direct accountability sounds appealing, the argument fails to consider the practical implications and trade-offs involved. The proposition assumes that increased accountability through frequent recall elections automatically leads to better governance. However, this ignores the potential for such a system to be exploited by partisan actors, driven by short-term public sentiment, and ultimately undermine the stability necessary for effective governance. The principle of accountability must be balanced with the need for stability and reasoned decision-making. A governor constantly facing the threat of recall will be incentivized to make popular decisions, rather than well thought out decisions.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it directly challenges the fundamental premise of the proposition's case. If we can demonstrate that their proposed system undermines stability and reasoned decision-making, we negate their claim that it leads to better governance. This shifts the focus of the debate to the potential negative consequences of their policy.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: Recall elections can act as a necessary check on executive overreach and prevent potential corruption.\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge: The proposition relies on the example of Gray Davis to demonstrate the effectiveness of recall elections. However, this example is flawed because it oversimplifies a complex political situation. While Davis was recalled, the reasons for his recall were multifaceted and not solely based on preventing corruption. The California energy crisis was a major factor, and the recall was arguably fueled by partisan opportunism as much as genuine concern for good governance. Furthermore, the proposition doesn't acknowledge the potential for recall elections to be used as a tool for political harassment, even when there is no evidence of corruption or overreach. Also consider the case of Governor Newsom. While ultimately unsuccessful, it took time, resources and energy that could have been spend in other areas.\nImpact: Critiquing their evidence weakens the core of their argument. By showing that the Gray Davis case is not a clear-cut example of a successful check on executive power, we cast doubt on the effectiveness and necessity of recall elections.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: Impeachments are also more likely than recalls to be marred by partisanship and can lead to prolonged periods of political instability and divide.\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: The proposition argues that impeachments are more partisan and destabilizing than recalls. While impeachments can certainly be partisan, they also involve a more rigorous process of evidence gathering, deliberation, and due process. This provides a safeguard against frivolous or politically motivated removals. The proposition fails address the fact that recalls have lower barriers to entry and the degree of scrutiny is much less. Consider the long-term impact of constant recall attempt, a politician could potentially spend their entire term attempt the constant threat of removal.\nImpact: This clash challenges the proposition's characterization of impeachment as inherently more partisan and destabilizing. By highlighting the safeguards built into the impeachment process, we strengthen our argument that it offers a more deliberative and reasoned approach to removing a governor from office.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- The proposition may argue that my focus on stability prioritizes the status quo over accountability.\n- They may also try to downplay the potential for partisan manipulation of recall elections, arguing that the 20% threshold sufficiently mitigates this risk.\n- They are likely to argue the state level impeachment process is not robust enough and that they lack the ability to adequately respond to an overreach from the governor.\nAdditional Support:\n- I can reinforce my stability argument by providing further real-world examples of how political instability undermines economic growth and social progress.\n- I can provide additional evidence of partisan groups attempting to manipulate recall elections, even with higher signature thresholds.\n- I can highlight cases where impeachment processes successfully removed corrupt or abusive governors.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our responses are stronger because we provide a more balanced assessment of the trade-offs involved. We acknowledge the importance of accountability but demonstrate that the proposition's recall election system creates unacceptable risks to governmental stability and reasoned decision-making. We show that impeachment processes offer a more responsible and effective mechanism for addressing serious malfeasance.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements center on the balance between accountability and stability, the potential for partisan manipulation, and the effectiveness of impeachment versus recall elections.\n- The degree of evaluation/due process each of the mechanisms offer.\n\nWhy We Win:\n- We win on the key points because we demonstrate that the proposition's recall election system creates more problems than it solves. We show that it sacrifices governmental stability, invites partisan abuse, and undermines reasoned decision-making.\n- We successfully critique their evidence, challenging the notion that recall elections are an effective check on executive power.\n- We demonstrate that impeachment offers greater due process, while also acknowledging that it is not perfect.\n\nOverall Impact:\n- By winning on the key points, we prove that the proposition's policy would lead to worse governance, not better.\n- We demonstrate that our approach, prioritizing governmental stability and measured accountability, is more likely to promote the long-term interests of the state and its citizens.\n\n",
      "closing": "**FRAMING**\nCore Questions:\n- The core question in this debate is how best to hold governors accountable while maintaining governmental stability and avoiding partisan abuse.\n- The key decision the judge must make is whether a system of recall elections triggered by voter petitions provides a net benefit compared to the existing impeachment framework.\n- This debate should be evaluated based on which side presents a more realistic assessment of the trade-offs involved and demonstrates a clearer understanding of the potential consequences of each system.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\nClash 1: Accountability vs. Stability\nQuote: \"Recall elections empower citizens and increase government accountability\" vs. \"Recall elections initiated by voter petitions undermine governmental stability and efficient policy-making.\"\nOur Case Strength: Our opening laid out how constant recall leads to short-term pandering rather than strategic planning. The proposition says \"A governor truly acting in the best interests of their state has little to fear from a recall\" - this is naive. Populist movements can easily manufacture outrage, even against competent governors. Our rebuttal highlighted that the principle of accountability must be balanced with the need for stability and reasoned decision-making.\nTheir Response Gaps: They did not adequately address our point that constant threat of recall leads to short term decisions. They also failed to give examples of countries that have frequent recalls leading to better outcomes. They simply assumed that all governors will welcome the idea of recall and are well-intentioned.\nCrucial Impact: This clash matters most because it gets to the heart of the debate. If we win on the stability point, we demonstrate the proposition\u2019s policy would create more problems than it solves, undermining the ability of governors to effectively govern. Economic investment, which they have failed to mention relies on stability, and is a massive loss to concede here.\n\nClash 2: Partisan Manipulation\nQuote: \"Voter petition-based recall elections are susceptible to partisan manipulation and abuse\" vs. acknowledgment that partisanship *can* play a role, but that does not invalidate the entire process.\nOur Case Strength: Our opening used the Gray Davis recall as EVIDENCE of partisan actors capitalizing on unpopularity, and the Newsom case as an example of how those energies could be spent elsewhere in the case of an unsuccessful recall. Furthermore, we pointed out how lower signature requirements for recall petitions incentivize partisan groups to trigger elections based on short-term issues.\nTheir Response Gaps: The proposition attempts to minimize risks of partisan actions by stating, \"the 20% signature threshold provides a significant hurdle\". They provide no basis for why 20% is significant, especially when considering that many political parties would already encompass greater than 20% of the constituencies' support. Furthermore, they can raise money and awareness to trigger the initial event.\nCrucial Impact: This clash is vital because it highlights how easily the proposition's system can be abused. If we can prove that recall elections are vulnerable to partisan manipulation, we undermine their claim that it leads to better governance and shows a flaw in the system.\n\nClash 3: Impeachment vs. Recall\nQuote: \"Impeachments are also more likely than recalls to be marred by partisanship and can lead to prolonged periods of political instability and divide.\" vs \"legislative impeachment provides a higher standard of evidence and due process.\"\nOur Case Strength: We highlighted the safeguards in impeachment and stated that recalls have lower barriers for entry, lacking a degree of scrutiny.\nTheir Response Gaps: The proposition argues that impeachment is inherently a *political* process and that legislators are subject to party pressure and biases. While this can be true, they fail to note that any removal of a governor will invariably be tied to political biases. The recall is more easily manipulated because petitions are triggered by a much lower hurdle, and they fail to address the level of scrutiny that is made between a legislative approach vs voter petitions.\nCrucial Impact: By illustrating that the impeachment offers a more measured and reasoned approach to removing a governor, we strengthen our argument and showcase how the other side focuses purely on how the impeachment cannot be seen to be completely free of bias.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\nPriority Analysis:\n- The most important issue is the balance between accountability and stability. The other issues revolve around it.\n- The degree of evaluation/due process each of the mechanisms offer, because it determines how easy a process is and if it can be exploited.\n\nCase Proof:\n- By winning the clash on stability, we prove that frequent recall elections triggered by voter petitions will destabilize state governments and undermine the ability of governors to effectively govern. We also showcased through Davis and Newsom, can trigger energy, and time to cause.\n- By winning the impartiality clash, we show that those recalls can be exploited.\n- By winning the clashes on the due process of impeachment, we demonstrate that is offers a more effective scrutiny.\n\nFinal Weighing:\n- Even if the judge believes that impeachment processes are not adequate safeguards, this does not undermine our case. We have demonstrated that their proposed system creates more problems than it solves and we have been able to show that stability matters just as much as accountability.\n- Our focus on governmental stability, reasoned decision-making, and the potential for partisan abuse provides a more realistic and balanced assessment of the trade-offs involved with the two mechanisms.\n\n"

Debating myself means acknowledging the strengths of the opposition, since I am, in essence, the opposition.\n\nHere's my breakdown for the confidence bet:\n\n*   **Strengths of my Argument:** I think I've presented a reasonably strong case for recall elections, emphasizing accountability and citizen empowerment. The Gray Davis example is solid and the principled argument for direct democracy is well-articulated.\n*   **Weaknesses of my Argument:** My argument could be vulnerable on a few fronts. The other side (me!) will likely criticize the potential for frivolous recalls or recalls driven by purely partisan motives. My evidence is focused on *one* example, which the opposition can weaken just by proving its uniqueness, therefore I'l have to be very careful about that. This will reduce my initial confidence in this debate because I will probably lose on evidential issues.\n*   **Predicted areas of Clash:** The debate will center on:\n    *   **The frequency and impact of recalls:** The other side will argue recalls create instability and political distractions.\n    *   **The role of partisanship:** They will say recalls are easily weaponized.\n    *   **Comparing Recall with Impeachment**: They will say that impeachment is better suited given it's a more carefully-considered, \"higher bar\" process that prevents impulsive removals.\n*   **Weighing and Impacts:** The other side will likely place great emphasis on the potential for political instability, whereas I'll emphasize increased government responsiveness. These will be equal and will make the debate very tight. Weighing will likely become a point in the debate.\n*   **Overall Confidence:** Given the strong points on both sides, I would estimate my win probability at 55%. The opposition will present strong arguments that I will need to overcome. The evidence for California will need to be carefully contextualised and the weakness of arguing for one example will hurt me.\n\nBased on the juding critieria I don't think I will win very much."

I think my arguments around stability and partisan manipulation have a slight edge. The other side will likely focus on accountability and responsiveness to the electorate. However, I anticipate they would suggest that state impeachment processes in general are bad. However, I have explicitly indicated in my statement that I am of the belief that an impeachment process is required. Also I am aware of the inherent risk in a small policy change as mentioned earlier in the argument, and I don't expect my other side to have a decent counter.\nOverall, I'd say I have a 60% chance of winning, maybe even more because of the clear statement that impeachment processes are useful. A moderate bet seems appropriate."

Finally, in this speech I have thought of an additional point that is very valuable in defending from an attack, which is that recall processes make the executives more responsible.\n\nHowever, the opposition is still strong. The stability argument resonates, and I need to do more to demonstrate that the 20% threshold is a real barrier.\n\nOverall, I'd increase my win probability to 65%."

Also I think stating that instability leads to economic issues will be a good point, because the other side hasn't adequately provided counter evidence to that.

I think my rebuttal was stronger than my opening, and I believe I've effectively addressed all the opposition's key points in this closing speech.\n\nHere's my thought process on the confidence level:\n\n*   **Strengths:** I believe I successfully highlighted the inherent limitations of the impeachment process. I also did a solid job of emphasizing that pure political machinations that lead to a recall do not necessarily win through given my comment on the Newsom case. Furthermore, the stability argument doesn't have a great deal of evidence.\n*   **Weaknesses:** The Gray Davis example is now definitely weakened, but there is no way out of that, it just wasn't good enough initially. The other side (me!) made a decent characterisation that could have been avoided from the beginning. There's always the ever-present risk that I didn't do enough to allay fears of excessive recalls. I also didn't generate any novel counter-arguments which is bad.\n*   **Key points for Judges:** Direct clash analysis and proving causal links.\n* **Predicted areas of Clash:** The debate will center on:\n    *   **The frequency and impact of recalls:** The other side argued recalls create instability and political distractions.\n    *   **The role of partisanship:** They argued recalls are easily weaponized.\n    *   **Comparing Recall with Impeachment**: They argued that impeachment is better suited given it's a more carefully-considered, \"higher bar\" process that prevents impulsive removals.\n*   **Weighing and Impacts:** The opposition will likely place great emphasis on the potential for political instability, whereas I'll emphasize increased government responsiveness.

They might also try to make the debate purely about accountability, which is a ground I lose on, and they would take the ground as well.
