    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

True media responsibility requires balanced representation, not unchecked editorial discretion.\n\nKey Counterarguments:\n- Media independence does not mean unrestricted platforms for majority perspectives\n- Democratic media requires structural mechanisms ensuring diverse political representation\n- Current system allows dominant political narratives to marginalize alternative viewpoints\n- Regulated fairness enhances, rather than restricts, genuine journalistic purpose\n\nEmpirical Support:\n- Countries with stronger media equity laws (Nordic democracies) demonstrate more robust, representative public discourse\n- Media concentration trends show increasing editorial homogeneity\n- Current voluntary guidelines have systematically failed to address representation disparities\n\nImpact: Winning this point proves that regulated fairness is a democratic necessity, not a constraint on journalistic integrity.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Practical Implementation Challenges\nOriginal Claim: \"The regulation creates unmanageable logistical and definitional complexities.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\n\nChallenge:\n- Existing regulatory frameworks in telecommunications and electoral media already manage complex implementation requirements\n- Technical solutions like standardized polling methodologies and clear prime-time definitions are readily achievable\n- Implementation challenges are surmountable administrative tasks, not fundamental barriers\n\nComparative Evidence:\n- European broadcasting regulations already mandate similar proportionality requirements\n- Technical infrastructure for tracking and implementing such regulations exists\n- Incremental implementation allows for adaptive policy refinement\n\nImpact: Demonstrates that administrative complexity is not a substantive argument against democratic media representation.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Unintended Democratic Consequences\nOriginal Claim: \"Mandated coverage might paradoxically reduce meaningful political discourse by amplifying marginal voices.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\n\nChallenge:\nThe opposition's argument fundamentally misunderstands democratic pluralism:\n- Marginal voices are not inherently less valuable\n- Exposure creates accountability and prevents political echo chambers\n- Current system systematically excludes emerging political perspectives\n- Democratic discourse requires hearing diverse viewpoints, not just established narratives\n\nPrinciple of Democratic Representation:\n- Political relevance is dynamic, not static\n- Polling thresholds provide objective, neutral mechanism for inclusion\n- Prevents entrenched political establishments from controlling narrative\n\nImpact: Shows that inclusive media representation strengthens, not weakens, democratic communication.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Potential administrative complexity\n- Concerns about gaming the system\n- Implementation cost considerations\n\nAdditional Support:\n- Clear, measurable implementation guidelines\n- Adaptive regulatory frameworks\n- Periodic review mechanisms\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Principled approach to media fairness\n- Empirically supported democratic enhancement\n- Structural solution to systemic media representation problems\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n1.

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH (OPPOSITION)\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Mandating equal media coverage would fundamentally undermine media editorial independence and journalistic freedom.\n\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n- Principle of Press Freedom: Journalistic outlets have a constitutional and ethical right to determine their own content and editorial priorities\n- Editorial discretion is a cornerstone of democratic media systems\n- Forcing proportional coverage transforms news from informative reporting to mandatory political platform distribution\n\nConnection: Compelling media to provide equal coverage regardless of political relevance transforms news from an informative service into a regulated political advertisement platform.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: The proposed regulation would create perverse incentives that could actually harm democratic discourse.\n\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- Countries with strict media equity laws (e.g., Venezuela, Russia) have demonstrated how mandated coverage can be manipulated\n- Small fringe parties could exploit the regulation to gain unearned media attention\n- Current media watchdog systems already provide accountability mechanisms\n- Empirical studies show voluntary guidelines are more effective than rigid legislative mandates\n\nConnection: Mandatory coverage requirements create systemic vulnerabilities that can be gamed by strategic political actors, potentially reducing rather than enhancing democratic representation.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: The 10% polling threshold is an arbitrary metric that does not reflect genuine political significance.\n\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n- Polling numbers fluctuate and do not represent consistent political relevance\n- Small parties might temporarily cross 10% threshold without sustained political infrastructure\n- Reduces media's ability to editorially assess newsworthiness and public interest\n- Creates potential for mathematical gaming of media exposure\n\nConnection: An inflexible numerical threshold undermines journalistic judgment about what constitutes genuinely important political information.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nThe proposed regulation fundamentally misunderstands media's role in democratic discourse. By transforming news from an informative platform to a regulated political distribution mechanism, we risk:\n- Reducing journalistic independence\n- Creating perverse political manipulation opportunities\n- Undermining genuine editorial assessment of public interest\n\nThe current voluntary guidelines provide more nuanced, adaptable accountability than rigid legislative mandates.

      "rebuttal": "OPPOSITION REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nCLASH POINT 1: Media Independence\nOriginal Claim: Regulation is necessary to ensure fair media representation\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\n\nChallenge:\nThe proposition fundamentally misunderstands media dynamics by treating news coverage as a mathematical distribution problem rather than an editorial process. Their assumption that mandated coverage creates fairness is deeply flawed because:\n\n1. Editorial judgment is not a bureaucratic error to be \"corrected\" but a critical journalistic function\n2. Forced coverage does not guarantee meaningful representation\n3. Numerical thresholds cannot capture nuanced political significance\n\nThe principle of editorial discretion protects against:\n- Potential political manipulation\n- Reduction of news to a mechanical distribution platform\n- Loss of contextual reporting quality\n\nImpact: Winning this point proves that the proposed regulation would fundamentally damage media's democratic function, transforming journalism from an investigative practice to a compliance exercise.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Implementation Challenges\nOriginal Claim: The 10% polling threshold provides a clear, objective standard for media coverage\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\n\nChallenge:\nThe polling threshold is fundamentally unreliable because:\n- Polling data is volatile and can shift dramatically within short periods\n- Methodological differences between polls create inconsistent baselines\n- Temporary polling spikes do not represent sustained political relevance\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests:\n- Polling methodologies have margin of error typically between 3-5%\n- Small sample sizes can dramatically skew representation\n- Short-term political events can cause temporary polling fluctuations\n\nThe proposition's \"objective\" standard is inherently subjective and potentially manipulable.\n\nImpact: Demonstrates the regulatory framework's fundamental lack of substantive rigor and potential for systemic gaming.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Democratic Discourse Quality\nOriginal Claim: Mandated coverage will improve political representation\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\n\nChallenge:\nContrary to the proposition's claim, mandated coverage would likely REDUCE quality of democratic discourse by:\n- Incentivizing performative political messaging\n- Providing platforms to potentially extreme or non-viable political perspectives\n- Fragmenting public attention across multiple marginally relevant actors\n\nComparative Evidence:\n- Countries with strict media equity laws (Venezuela, Russia) show how mandated coverage can be manipulated\n- Current voluntary accountability mechanisms have proven more adaptive and responsive\n- Market competition already provides natural mechanisms for political visibility\n\nImpact: Proves that the proposed regulation would likely harm rather than enhance democratic communication.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Potential critique of current media accountability mechanisms\n- Accusations of protecting media oligopolies\n- Claims of elitism in editorial discretion\n\nAdditional Support:\n- Emphasize existing media watchdog frameworks\n- Highlight market-driven accountability\n- Demonstrate flexibility of current systems\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Principled defense of journalistic independence\n- Evidence-based critique of proposed regulation\n- Demonstrated potential for systemic harm\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n1.
