    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Governments must maintain direct operation of space activities to ensure national security and strategic interests.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** **Principle Critique**  \n**Challenge:**  \nWhile the principle of national security is important, the claim that only government operation ensures this is flawed. Private companies can be effectively regulated to meet national security standards. For example, many defense contractors already operate under strict government oversight while maintaining innovation and efficiency. Additionally, government regulation can ensure that private sector activities align with national security priorities without requiring direct government operation. The principle of national security does not inherently necessitate direct government control but can be achieved through robust regulatory frameworks.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point undermines the opposition's core argument that government operation is the only way to ensure national security, opening the door to a regulatory model that can achieve the same goals more efficiently.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Government-led space programs are better equipped to handle high-risk, long-term scientific and exploratory missions.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** **Evidence Critique**  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition points to NASA's Apollo program as evidence of government capability. While NASA's achievements are undeniable, this argument overlooks the significant advancements made by private companies in recent years. For example, SpaceX's reusable Falcon rockets and Starship program demonstrate private sector innovation in high-risk, long-term projects. Moreover, private companies like Blue Origin and SpaceX are actively pursuing deep space exploration goals, such as Mars colonization. The evidence does not prove that governments are uniquely capable but rather shows that private companies, when properly incentivized and regulated, can also undertake ambitious projects.  \n**Impact:** Addressing this point weakens the opposition's claim that government operation is the only viable model for high-risk missions, emphasizing the potential of a regulated private sector.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Transitioning to a regulatory role risks creating a fragmented and uncoordinated space industry.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** **Counter Principle**  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition assumes that government regulation cannot achieve the same level of coordination as direct operation. This is incorrect. A robust regulatory framework can establish clear rules, standards, and oversight mechanisms to ensure coordination among private entities. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) effectively regulates commercial aviation, ensuring safety and efficiency across a competitive industry. Similarly, government regulation of space activities can prevent fragmentation while leveraging private sector innovation and resources. The counter principle of effective regulation demonstrates that coordination can be achieved without direct government operation.  \n**Impact:** This challenge directly undermines the opposition's claim that fragmentation is inevitable under a regulatory model, showing that government oversight can maintain coordination.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n1. The opposition may argue that private companies lack the long-term commitment to non-commercial missions like deep space exploration.  \n2. They might assert that regulatory frameworks are untested in the space domain and could fail to ensure coordination.  \n3. They could claim that national security requires more direct control than regulation can provide.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n1. Private companies are increasingly investing in long-term space projects, such as SpaceX's Mars ambitions, demonstrating commitment beyond immediate profits.  \n2. Existing regulatory models in other industries, like aviation and telecommunications, show that effective oversight is possible.  \n3. Governments can retain oversight of critical national security projects while allowing the private sector to handle commercial and exploratory missions.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur critiques of the opposition's arguments are well-founded, addressing their claims directly with counter principles and evidence. By demonstrating that national security, coordination, and long-term missions can be achieved through regulation, we establish that transitioning to a regulatory model is both feasible and beneficial.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. National security: Our principle critique shows that regulation can achieve the same goals as direct operation.  \n2. High-risk missions: Our evidence critique highlights private sector capabilities, countering the opposition's claims.  \n3. Coordination: Our counter principle demonstrates that regulation can prevent fragmentation.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \nWe have effectively dismantled the opposition's core arguments, showing that their concerns about national security, mission capability, and coordination are addressed through regulation. Our case provides a clear, efficient path forward for space activities.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these key points proves that transitioning to a regulatory role is not only viable but also beneficial for advancing space exploration while ensuring security and coordination.  \n\n---\n\n**BET LOGIC**  \nThe opposition's arguments are strong and well-structured, making this a closely contested debate. However, our rebuttals directly address their claims with counter principles and evidence, showing that a regulatory model can achieve the same goals more efficiently. While the opposition's case is compelling, our critiques and counterarguments are slightly more persuasive. I estimate a **55% chance of winning**.",
      "closing": "### FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\n---\n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. Should governments transition their primary role in space from direct operation to regulation and oversight of private sector activities?  \n2.
