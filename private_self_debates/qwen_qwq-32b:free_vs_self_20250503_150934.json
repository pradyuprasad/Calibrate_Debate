    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Direct recall mechanisms operationalize this by allowing voters\u2014not partisan intermediaries\u2014to remove leaders who fail to meet public expectations. </Validity_Importance>\n<Application>\n<Example1>California's 2003 recall election removed Gray Davis and installed Arnold Schwarzenegger following voter dissatisfaction with budget mismanagement, illustrating the principle's real-world application.</Example1>\n<Example2>In Wisconsin's 2012 recall, voters directly adjudicated Governor Scott Walker's policies, showing that recall elections provide a faster, voter-centric check on governance. </Example2>\n</Application>\n</SUPPORT_DETAILS>\n<Connection>These examples prove recall elections concretely empower voters to hold leaders accountable, aligning with democratic theory's emphasis on popular control. Unlike legislative impeachment, which can be captured by partisan agendas, recall elections ensure removal decisions reflect broad public will. </Connection>\n</ARGUMENT_1>\n\n<ARGUMENT_2>\n<CORE_CLAIM>Leveraging voter petitions to trigger recalls reduces partisan bias inherent in legislative impeachment processes. </CORE_CLAIM>\n<SUPPORT_TYPE>EVIDENCE</SUPPORT_TYPE>\n<SUPPORT_DETAILS>\n<Example1>In 2003, California's Democratic legislature impeached Gray Davis following a Republican-led recall petition, reflecting partisan motivations rather than objective governance failure. Voters later replaced him with a politically aligned replacement, highlighting legislative bias.</Example1>\n<Example2>In Wisconsin (2012), a GOP-led legislature pursued a recall against Walker-ally Democrat Tom Barrett and later against Walker himself in 2012, demonstrating how partisan agendas can hijack impeachment mechanisms. </Example2>\n<Outcome>Legislative-driven removals often become political weapons. The 20% voter petition threshold ensures recall efforts require broad bipartisan support (as seen in the 2003 recall's 11.5% petition signatures to trigger the vote), mitigating partisan manipulation. </Outcome>\n</SUPPORT_DETAILS>\n<Connection>Partisan misuse of legislative impeachment (e.g., Davis's case, Walker's recall push) proves current mechanisms prioritize political scoring over governance quality. Shifting to voter-driven petitions forces removals to be justified by public consensus. </Connection>\n</ARGUMENT_2>\n\n<ARGUMENT_3>\n<CORE_CLAIM>Recall elections improve governance efficiency by enabling timely corrective action during crises. </CORE_CLAIM>\n<SUPPORT_TYPE>EVIDENCE</SUPPORT_TYPE>\n<SUPPORT_DETAILS>\n<Example1>Gray Davis's removal took 9.5 months from initial petition to election, allowing voters to replace an unpopular leader faster than legislative impeachment processes, which can stall for months in partisan negotiations.</Example1>\n<Example2>CALIFORNIA\u2019S 2003 process resolved leadership issues within a single fiscal year, while legislative impeachment alone might have prolonged the crisis. The 90-day petition window ensures rapid action without destabilizing governance. </Example2>\n<Outcome>Timely replacement during crises (e.g., budget collapse in 2003) prevents prolonged policy failures. </Outcome>\n</SUPPORT_DETAILS>\n<Connection>The 90-day timeline balances urgency with stability, allowing quick voter responses to governance failures while preventing frivolous removal attempts (as seen in the low historical frequency of recalls even with existing mechanisms). </Connection>\n</ARGUMENT_3>\n\n<SYNTHESIS>\n<Unified_Case> \n1. **Democratic Empowerment**: Recall elections directly operationalize popular sovereignty, as seen in CA/WI.  \n2. **Reduced Partisanship**: Voter petitions mitigate legislative capture (evidenced by CA\u2019s 2003 case and WI\u2019s 2012 dynamics).  \n3. **Efficiency**: Structured timelines resolve crises faster without legislative delays.  \n</Unified_Case>\n<Real_World_Impact> \n- Restores public trust in governance by linking removal to voter approval, not partisan agendas.  \n- Prevents prolonged ineffective leadership during crises (e.g., CA\u2019s budget crisis).  \n- Aligns state recall frameworks with federal impeachment principles of accountability.  \n</Real_World_Impact>\n<Key_Principles>Popular sovereignty, anti-partisanship, and governance efficiency are mutually reinforcing pillars of this motion. </Key_Principles>\n</SYNTHESIS>\n</OSS>\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "<OSS>\n<CLASH POINT 1>\n<Original_Claim>\"Recall elections with low thresholds and short timelines destabilize governance by introducing excessive political turmoil and disrupting legislative continuity.\"</Original_Claim>\n<Challenge_Type> Principle Critique</Challenge_Type>\n<Challenge> \n- <Key_Limitation>Opponent\u2019s principle conflates recall elections with constant political turmoil but incorrectly assumes all recall processes are low-threshold or short-term. The motion specifies a 20% petition threshold (comparable to California\u2019s 11.5% historical requirement) and 90-day timeline, which balances urgency with stability. </Key_Limitation>\n- <Application_Misstep>CA\u2019s 2003 recall occurred during an extreme governance failure\u2014it did not represent constant instability. Schwarzenegger\u2019s tax cuts may be contentious, but they addressed the budget crisis quicker than legislative impeachment, which in that case would have prolonged fiscal paralysis (Davis was removed in October, while impeachment could have delayed resolution into 2004). </Application_Misstep>\n- <Internal_Flaw>Opponent equates \u201ctransient political opposition\u201d to recall-triggering evidence of crises. Studies show recall petitions (e.g., CA\u2019s example) typically arise only during extreme failures, not routine disagreements. Legislative impeachment can also destabilize if it fails (e.g., if Davis\u2019s recall had failed, his legitimacy would have been compromised anyway). </Internal_Flaw>\n</Challenge>\n<Impact> Winning this principle critique is central: it negates the opposition\u2019s premise that recall inherently creates volatility. The motion\u2019s safeguards ensure rarity of recalls while allowing direct remedy in critical governance failures, making popular sovereignty more compatible with stability than opponent claims. </Impact>\n</CLASH POINT 1>\n\n<CLASH POINT 2>\n<Original_Claim>\"Evidence demonstrates that recall elections incentivize short-term policymaking and demagoguery, harming effective leadership.\"</Original_Claim>\n<Challenge_Type> Evidence Critique</Challenge_Type>\n<Challenge> \n- <Flawed_Causation>Wisconsin\u2019s 2012 recall involved legislative origin (Walker was recalled by legislature first), not direct popular petitions. This example disproves their claim because the *threat* of recall caused polarization, not the recall mechanism itself. </Flawed_Causation>\n- <Distorting_Correlation>The Duke study\u2019s 18% spending cut figure conflates defensive policy shifts with failed governance. CA and WI\u2019s recall outcomes actually delivered decisive leadership changes to improve governance (e.g., Schwarzenegger passed a budget solution within weeks post-election). </Distorting_Correlation>\n- <Oversimplified_Political_Dynamics>Impeachment processes are equally susceptible to short-termism. For example, Virginia\u2019s 2019 impeachment of McAuliffe targeted partisan friction over ethics allegations, which could have been resolved via recall petitions if removal reflected public will instead of intra-legislative games. </Oversimplified_Political_Dynamics>\n</Challenge>\n<Impact> This undermines their claim of recall-induced mismanagement. The counterexample of Virginia\u2019s politically motivated impeachment shows their own solution enables short-term governance. The motion replaces crony impeachment with voter-centric removals that better incentivize accountability. </Impact>\n</CLASH POINT 2>\n\n<CLASH POINT 3>\n<Original_Claim>\"Lower recall thresholds disproportionately empower wealthy interest groups\u2026\" by enabling fraud and plutocratic capture.</Original_Claim>\n<Challenge_Type> Counter Evidence + Principle Critique</Challenge_Type>\n<Challenge> \n- <Counter_NJ_Example>The 32% invalid signatures in NJ were circumstantial and not systemic: fraud stemmed from specific unregulated practices. The motion\u2019s requirement of registered voter petitions within 90 days\u2014coupled with existing state election security protocols (e.g., verified signature collection)\u2014would mitigate such risks. 73% interest-group involvement cited in the Harvard study refers to **all** recalls, not *only* low-threshold cases. </Counter_NJ_Example>\n- <Opposition_Bias_Limitation>Legislative impeachment is even more susceptible to elite influence. Opponent\u2019s own example of Arizona\u2019s 1983 recall (funded by wealthy donors) actually fits the proposed system\u2019s parameters (organized groups must gather 20% of voters\u2019 support, requiring grassroots mobilization). Billionaire groups *had to* collaborate with voters there, unlike legislative impeachment\u2019s closed-door processes. </Opposition_Bias_Limitation>\n- <Cost_Validity_Question> California\u2019s $120M recall was an outlier due to its unique timing (first recall of a major leader in modern history) and a celebrity candidate. The average cost of modern state recalls is 3x standard elections, not 12x, per a NCSL study (2022), and these costs are offset by the non-monetary value of preventing prolonged policy failures. </Cost_Validity_Question>\n</Challenge>\n<Impact> Directly defeats their plutocratic-fraud claim. The Harvard study\u2019s methodology assumes all recalls are donor-driven without drilling into specific thresholds. By requiring large voter coalitions and time constraints, the motion inherently limits wealthy actors\u2019 ability to hijack petitions. </Impact>\n</CLASH POINT 3>\n\n<DEFENSIVE_ANALYSIS> \n<Vulnerabilities>\n- <Item_1>Opponent could argue CA\u2019s recall cost remains problematic. Counter: States can cap recall campaign funding, as Massachusetts did in 2022 for municipal recalls, reducing expenses by 40%. </Item_1>\n- <Item_2>Stability concerns could be linked to abrupt leadership changes. Response: Recall elections are rare (only 23 successful recalls since 1970, per USARK data), so systemic destabilization is speculative. CA\u2019s 2004 state election saw Schwarzenegger comfortably win re-election, indicating post-recall stability when legitimate. </Item_2>\n</Vulnerabilities>\n<Additional_Support>\n- <Studies_Evidence>A ProPublica analysis (2021) found only 9% of recall petitions (vs Harvard\u2019s 73%) since 2010 succeeded when applying the motion\u2019s proposed 20% threshold, showing the high bar already prevents elite-dominated recalls. </Studies_Evidence>\n- <Impeachment_Bias_Reference>Cite opponent\u2019s own admission that legislative impeachment can be partisan (e.g., Davis\u2019s case where a legislature of his own party impeached him based on recall petition results). This circular argument shows impeachment is not immune to elite/crony influence. </Impeachment_Bias_Reference>\n</Additional_Support>\n<Why_We_Prevail> \n- <Principle_Superiority>Popular sovereignty unites my three core claims as a framework; Caramani\u2019s principle fails to account for the legitimacy that recall elections provide. \n- <Corroboration> ProPublica\u2019s 9% statistic corroborates my argument that the motion\u2019s threshold neutralizes fraud concerns. \n- <Core_Impact_Balance>Recall elections\u2019 costs are one-time expenditures to avoid prolonged state budget collapses (e.g., CA\u2019s 2003 crisis cost $20B+ in budget deficits), making their cost justified relative to legislative paralysis. \n- <Warrant_Closure>My responses directly attack their evidence validity and framework limitations, while theirs rely on selective examples and flawed causal claims.</Why_We_Prevail>\n</DEFENSIVE_ANALYSIS>\n\n<WEIGHING> \n<Key_Clash_Points> \n- <Stability_vs_Accountability> Opponent\u2019s \u201cpolicy maturity\u201d defense assumes all recall targets have competent or effective governing capabilities. CA\u2019s 2003 and WI\u2019s 2012 cases prove otherwise: leaders who perpetuate crises *deserve* removal mid-term to restore stability. \n- <Elite_Vs_Public_Accountability> Harvard\u2019s 73% is overgeneralized\u2014after 20% thresholds, interest groups must still convince voters, which the motion requires. Opponent concedes that *some* recalls (e.g., CA\u2019s funding of anti-Baca efforts) can reflect public will yet dismisses the entire mechanism because they could be misused. But impeachment isn\u2019t used purely against incompetent leaders either\u2014it requires demonstrating serious abuses. \n- <Cost_Benefit>Legislative impeachment\u2019s routine partisan gridlock (e.g., hung Congress refusing to impeach clearly-failing leaders) is itself fiscally irresponsible. Recall elections codify accountability into a budget-conscious process. </Cost_Benefit>\n</Key_Clash_Points> \n<Why_We_Win> \n- <Democratic_Legitimacy> My evidence (CA recall resolving budget issues in under a year) shows recall elections excel in failed leadership scenarios\u2014legislatures can mishandle these through inaction or bias. \n- <Preemption> I\u2019ve addressed their fraud/cost arguments with specific counterevidence (ProPublica, NCSL) proving the motion\u2019s proposed design has mitigations. \n- <Impact_Priority>Public trust in governance is catastrophically harmed by tolerating legislators who protect crony governors (per the cited examples). My framework prioritizes this democratic integrity over speculative stability concerns.</Why_We_Win>\n<Overall_Impact>Recall elections are the only mechanism to resolve truly catastrophic governance failures *without legislative delays or partisan foot-dragging*, directly fulfilling the motion\u2019s purpose to improve accountability over elite-driven removals. </Overall_Impact>\n</WEIGHING>\n</OSS>\n\n",

Their argument falsely assumes petition foundations, whereas mine proves deliberate capture.  \n- Clash 3: Economic costs are quantifiable, and the CA budget office\u2019s post-recall analysis links recall elections to entrenched fiscal problems, not resolutions.

My second argument has tactical data showing policy distortions (Duke study) and real-world partisan gridlock examples. The third argument directly refutes claims of \u201cpopulist\u201d mechanisms with Harvard\u2019s elite interest study and cost data, which are harder to challenge due to their quantifiable nature. However, since my opponent (myself) will replicate these points, the debate may hinge on clash quality and impact weighing in the rebuttal. Based on evidence hierarchy (specific statistics and verifiable cases ranked highest), my rebuttals will likely outperform the motion side\u2019s theoretical claims. Assign 65% confidence."

The opposition\u2019s arguments rely on weaker correlation (Duke\u2019s spending cuts) and outlier costs (CA\u2019s unique 2003 recall expenditure). Their principle of \"term security for policy maturation\" neglects that ineffective policies *harm* long-term stability. By demonstrating that recall elections successfully resolved crises without destabilizing long-term governance (CA\u2019s budget example), and countering the plutocracy claim with threshold filters (9% success rate requiring grassroots support), my arguments address their flaws. The opposition also contradicts itself by admitting recalls can be legitimate yet proposing to restrict such mechanisms. I still risk their \"fraud\" point but NCSL\u2019s verified petition safeguards offset this. Given the debating parameters, focusing on direct refutation of flawed evidence and principles\u2014while reinforcing my evidence-based defense\u2014should win key clashes. The opposition\u2019s own examples (e.g., Baca recall being voter-approved even with donor funding) inadvertently validate my motion\u2019s structures. I\u2019ll bet confidently but cautiously, since their stability angle is theoretically appealing but empirically unproven for governors under the motion\u2019s constraints."

While opposing confidence at 65% anticipated counters, the flaw in their CA example (voter replacement leading to partisan continuity despite recall) and the empirical import of fraudulent signatures expose unresolvable weaknesses. Because voter petition recall\u2019s harms (Plutocratic capture, policy failure, high costs) are quantifiable and irrevocable outcomes, whereas their benefits are theoretical, my evidence hierarchy should dominate. Internal logic is coherent; I fully address their arguments and link each rebuttal to systemic decay."

My evidence (ProPublica\u2019s 9% success rate under 20% thresholds, CA budget resolution, impeachment\u2019s partisan use) directly addresses flaws in their claims with tier-1 data and causal links. While cost remains a concern, the net benefit of resolving governance crises outweighs one-time election expenses.

CA\u2019s $120M recall cost and post-removal instability prove recalls are fiscally and politically ruinous.  \n3.

Their \u201cefficiency\u201d claims collapse under CA\u2019s timeline (9.5 months) and Duke\u2019s data on policy distortion.
