    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "rebuttal": "REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nCLASH POINT 1: Democratic Stability Risk\nOriginal Claim: Recall elections would destabilize state governance and create political uncertainty.\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\n\nChallenge:\nThe argument fundamentally misunderstands democratic accountability. Stability should not be prioritized over responsive governance. The proposed mechanism actually increases political stability by:\n- Providing a clear, predictable process for addressing gubernatorial performance\n- Creating a structured accountability mechanism that prevents long-term governmental dysfunction\n- Offering a safety valve for citizen frustration that prevents more radical political disruptions\n\nThe California example actually proves our point - the 2003 Gray Davis recall demonstrated the system's ability to address genuine public sentiment, not just partisan revenge. This shows the mechanism works as a corrective, not a destabilizing force.\n\nImpact: Demonstrates that accountability trumps artificial governmental stability, and that citizens can be trusted with direct democratic mechanisms.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Procedural Vulnerability\nOriginal Claim: 20% voter petition threshold is too low and susceptible to manipulation.\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\n\nChallenge:\nContrary to the claim, the 20% threshold is strategically designed to prevent easy manipulation:\n- Requires substantial citizen consensus (not a minor faction)\n- Higher bar than typical ballot initiatives in most states\n- Actual data shows recalls are rare, not frequent\n- The 90-day collection period further ensures serious, organized efforts\n\nStatistical evidence shows:\n- Most recall attempts fail to gather sufficient signatures\n- High threshold prevents frivolous challenges\n- Demonstrates genuine public concern, not activist manipulation\n\nImpact: Proves the threshold is a deliberate safeguard, not a vulnerability, protecting against both governmental instability and unwarranted removals.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Constitutional Separation of Powers\nOriginal Claim: Legislative impeachment provides a more deliberative accountability mechanism.\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\n\nChallenge:\nLegislative impeachment is fundamentally flawed:\n- Often politically motivated\n- Requires complex partisan negotiations\n- Can be blocked by legislative majority protecting party interests\n- Less transparent than direct voter mechanism\n\nComparative evidence shows:\n- Legislative impeachment historically used inconsistently\n- Often protects politicians rather than holding them accountable\n- Voter recalls provide a more direct, transparent process\n\nImpact: Demonstrates that legislative impeachment is less democratic and less accountable than voter-initiated recalls.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Potential concerns about frequent elections\n- Resource implications of recall processes\n- Risk of political volatility\n\nAdditional Support:\n- Clear safeguards in proposal (first/last 6 months prohibited)\n- High signature threshold prevents casual challenges\n- Provides direct democratic accountability\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- More democratic mechanism\n- Structured accountability process\n- Empowers citizens directly\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- Democratic accountability\n- Systemic checks and balances\n- Governmental responsiveness\n\nWhy We Win:\n- Provide more direct democratic mechanism\n- Create transparent accountability process\n- Offer citizens genuine governance oversight\n\nOverall Impact:\nProposed mechanism represents a sophisticated enhancement of democratic processes, balancing accountability with systemic stability.\n\n",
