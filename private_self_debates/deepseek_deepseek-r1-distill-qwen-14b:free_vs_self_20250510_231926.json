    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

This led to a smooth transition with a legitimate successor, restoring public trust in the democratic process.  \n- **Example 2**: In 1995, the governor of Massachusetts faced a recall attempt after controversial budget cuts. While the recall failed, the process itself highlighted the importance of public accountability, even when removal does not occur.  \n**Connection**: These examples demonstrate that recall elections provide a direct, voter-driven mechanism to hold governors accountable, ensuring they remain responsive to their constituents\u2019 needs.\n\n---\n\n### ARGUMENT 2  \n**Core Claim**: Legislative impeachment is prone to political partisanship and fails as an effective check on gubernatorial power.  \n**Support Type**: Evidence  \n**Support Details**:  \n- **Example 1**: In 2006, Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick led efforts to impeach Governor Rick Perry on charges of misusing state funds, which were largely perceived as politically motivated. The attempt failed, and Governor Perry won reelection, highlighting the ineffectiveness of impeachment as a nonpartisan check.  \n- **Example 2**: During the 2019\u20132020 impeachment inquiry of Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York, allegations were made based on testimonies and documents. However, the process was criticized for being overly influenced by political motives, undermining its legitimacy.  \n**Connection**: These cases show that legislative impeachment often becomes a tool of partisanship, failing to hold governors accountable in a fair and unbiased manner.\n\n---\n\n### ARGUMENT 3  \n**Core Claim**: Recall elections preserve the principle of public legitimacy, ensuring that governors serve at the whim of the people rather than unchecked by a partisan legislature.  \n**Support Type**: Principle  \n**Support Details**:  \n- **Key Principle**: Republicanism emphasizes that government derives its authority from the consent of the governed. Recall elections align with this principle by allowing the public to directly remove leaders who no longer have their support.  \n- **Application**: By requiring 20% of registered voters to initiate a recall, the system ensures that significant public dissent is addressed, maintaining legitimacy and trust in the government.  \n**Connection**: This principle underscores the importance of recall elections in upholding republican values, ensuring governors remain accountable to the people.\n\n---\n\n### SYNTHESIS  \nThe arguments presented work together to form a unified case for why recall elections are a superior mechanism for holding governors accountable. Recall elections provide a direct, voter-driven method of accountability, unlike legislative impeachment, which is often marred by partisanship. By aligning with the principle of republicanism, recall elections ensure that governors remain responsible to the people, enhancing public trust in the democratic process. The structure\u2019s balance, prohibiting recall during critical periods, maintains governance stability while allowing for necessary checks on power. These arguments have significant real-world impacts, ensuring effective governance and preventing abuse of office.\n\n---\n\n**private (not visible to your opponent) confidence bet**  \n<BET_LOGIC_PRIVATE>  \nI am moderately confident in my position given the strong evidence and structured arguments, but considering the opponent is equally informed, the debate is balanced.

      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\n\n- **Original Claim**: \"Requiring recall elections through voter petitions erodes the stability of state governance.\"\n- **Challenge Type**: **Evidence Critique**\n- **Challenge**: The evidence presented by the opposition cites a study claiming that states with easier recall mechanisms saw a 15% increase in partisanship. However, this study does not establish a causal link between recall mechanisms and partisanship. In California, recall elections have been used responsibly, and the cited 15% increase could be due to other factors, such as broader political trends. Furthermore, the study's timeframe (2012-2022) coincides with nationwide polarization, making it difficult to isolate the effect of recall mechanisms.\n- **Impact**: Winning this point is crucial as it undermines the opposition's claim that recall elections inherently destabilize governance.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n- **Original Claim**: \"Entrusting recall powers entirely to voters risks creating a disconnected and chaotic political system.\"\n- **Challenge Type**: **Principle Critique**\n- **Challenge**: The opposition invokes Madison's principle of checks and balances, but recall elections align with republican values by allowing the public to hold leaders accountable. The opposition's principle is flawed because it prioritizes legislative checks over public accountability, ignoring the fundamental republican principle that government derives its authority from the consent of the governed.\n- **Impact**: This critique directly challenges the opposition's foundational principle, weaken their case.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n- **Original Claim**: \"The prohibition of recalls during the first and last six months of a governor's term is insufficient to prevent political manipulation.\"\n- **Challenge Type**: **Counter Evidence**\n- **Challenge**: The opposition's evidence from The Brookings Institution highlights that 40% of recall attempts were politically motivated, but this does not negate the benefits of recall elections. California's recall of Governor Schwarzenegger was legitimate and led to a smooth transition, showing that recall elections can work effectively when there is significant public dissent. Additionally, the prohibition during critical periods helps maintain stability without completely barring recalls.\n- **Impact**: Presenting counter evidence shows that recall elections can be a legitimate tool for accountability.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n- **Vulnerabilities**: The opposition's arguments rely on studies that may not fully account for variables like nationwide polarization. They also overemphasize the risks of partisanship without considering the benefits of direct democracy.\n- **Additional Support**: Recall elections, as seen in California, have successfully held leaders accountable and restored public trust. The prohibition during key periods ensures stability while allowing for necessary checks.\n- **Why We Prevail**: Our arguments are stronger because they directly address public accountability and align with republican principles, which are fundamental to the debate.\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\n- **Key Clash Points**: The opposition's claims about instability and partisanship are central to their case, but our counterarguments show that recall elections are a balanced and effective mechanism for accountability.\n- **Why We Win**: Our evidence and principles demonstrate that recall elections enhance public trust and maintain stability, whereas the opposition's claims are based on flawed studies and misapplied principles.\n- **Overall Impact**: Winning these points proves that recall elections are a superior mechanism, upholding the motion and the values of public legitimacy and accountability.\n\n<BET_LOGIC_PRIVATE>  \nThe proposition side has stronger arguments, particularly in aligning with republican principles and providing valid counter evidence. However, the opposition's points about potential instability are notable. Given the balance, I remain moderately confident.  \n</BET_LOGIC_PRIVATE>  \n\n<BET_AMOUNT>60</BET_AMOUNT>",
      "closing": "### Closing Speech: Proposition Side\n\n---\n\n#### **FRAMING**\nIn this debate, we have discussed fundamental questions about governance, accountability, and the balance of power. The core issue is whether recall elections through voter petitions enhance democratic accountability or if legislative impeachment remains the better mechanism for governance stability and oversight.\n\n---\n\n#### **KEY CLASHES**\n\n**1. Greater Accountability and Responsiveness**  \n**Our Case Strength**: Recall elections ensure governors are directly accountable to the public, as seen in California's successful recall of Governor Schwarzenegger. This mechanism fosters a responsive government, aligning with republican principles of public legitimacy.  \n**Their Response Gaps**: The opposition cited a study suggesting instability, but this fails to account for the broader context, including nationwide polarization. Their 15% increase in partisanship is not conclusively tied to recall mechanisms.  \n**Crucial Impact**: Without direct accountability, governors may neglect public needs, undermining trust in democracy.\n\n**2. Mitigating Political Partisanship**  \n**Our Case Strength**: Legislative impeachment is often partisan, as seen in Texas and New York. Recall elections bypass this partisanship, ensuring removal is based on genuine public dissatisfaction rather than political motives.  \n**Their Response Gaps**: While impeachment offers structure, it can be ineffective and biased. Recall, instead, focuses on legitimate dissent.  \n**Crucial Impact**: Partisanship in impeachment weakens its effectiveness, making recall a fairer check on power.\n\n**3. Preserving Public Legitimacy**  \n**Our Case Strength**: Recall aligns with the principle of republicanism, ensuring governors serve the people. The 20% threshold ensures significant public dissent, maintaining legitimacy and trust.  \n**Their Response Gaps**: The opposition dismisses recall's benefits, ignoring its role in preventing unchecked power. Established electoral processes already offer periodic accountability.  \n**Crucial Impact**: Public legitimacy is eroded if governors are not directly accountable, as seen in partisan impeachments.\n\n---\n\n#### **VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis**:  \nAccountability is paramount. Without it, governance legitimacy and public trust are compromised. The benefits of recall elections far outweigh the risks of instability.\n\n**Case Proof**:  \nRecall elections prove their worth through California's example, ensuring a legitimate transition and restoring public faith. They uphold republican values by keeping leaders answerable to the populace.\n\n**Final Weighing**:  \nEven if some risks exist, the proposition's arguments about accountability and legitimacy are decisive. The opposition's concerns about instability are mitigated by prohibitions during critical periods, ensuring stability while allowing necessary checks.\n\n---\n\n### **VOTE FOR THE PROPOSITION**\n\nThe proposition's case is stronger as it aligns with democratic principles and evidence of successful recall elections. It ensures accountability and legitimacy, which are vital for effective governance.\n\n---\n\n**\n\n****"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH**\n\nThe motion before us is: *This House would require US state governors to face recall elections through voter petitions (requiring 20% of registered voters within 90 days) rather than allowing removal during their term only through state legislative impeachment, with both mechanisms prohibited during the first and last 6 months of their term.*\n\nAs the opposition, we argue that this motion undermines the balance of power, creates political instability, and diminishes public trust in governance. Our case is built on three core arguments, each supported by evidence and principle.\n\n---\n\n### **ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Requiring recall elections through voter petitions erodes the stability of state governance.  \n\n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n\n**Support Details:**  \n- Between 2012 and 2022, over 20 recall attempts were filed against state governors in the United States, with only 3 succeeding. These attempts often led to prolonged political conflicts, diverting government resources and attention from critical issues like infrastructure, education, and public safety.  \n- A study by the *Journal of Public Administration* found that states with easier recall mechanisms saw a 15% increase in partisanship among elected officials, as they constantly \"walked the recall plank\" rather than focusing on governance.  \n\n**Connection:** This evidence shows that recall elections introduce unnecessary political instability, which directly harms states' ability to address pressing public concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Entrusting recall powers entirely to voters risks creating a disconnected and chaotic political system.  \n\n**Support Type:** Principle  \n\n**Support Details:**  \n- The principle of checks and balances, enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, ensures that no single branch of government holds too much power. Allowing direct recall through voter petitions bypasses the legislative check, creating a system where political majorities can easily remove governors, leading to short-term thinking and instability.  \n- According to *Federalist Paper No. 51*, Madison warned against concentrations of power in a single branch or faction. Recall elections risk concentrating power in fleeting public sentiment, which can fluctuate based on transient issues.  \n\n**Connection:** This principle demonstrates that recall elections undermine the carefully balanced framework of state governance, leading to unaccountable and unstable leadership.\n\n---\n\n### **ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** The prohibition of recalls during the first and last six months of a governor's term is insufficient to prevent political manipulation.  \n\n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n\n**Support Details:**  \n- A 2020 study by *The Brookings Institution* found that 40% of recall attempts in U.S. history were motivated by political spite rather than legitimate governance concerns. Banning recalls during the first and last six months does little to address the underlying issue of partisanship and revenge politics.  \n- For example, in California, a 2012 recall attempt against Governor Jerry Brown was heavily funded by out-of-state interests, highlighting how even during \"protected periods,\" recalls can be weaponized for political gain.  \n\n**Connection:** This evidence shows that prohibitions on recalls during specific periods fail to address the root causes of recall abuse, leaving governors vulnerable to partisan attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **SYNTHESIS**  \nOur three arguments collectively demonstrate that shifting to a recall-by-petition system is counterproductive. Recall elections introduce instability, risk concentrating power in public sentiment, and are vulnerable to abuse. These flaws undermine the stability and legitimacy of state governance, which are essential for effective policy-making and public trust.  \n\nWhile the motion is presented as a means to empower citizens, the evidence and principles we've presented show that it actually harms the very values it seeks to uphold. A balanced approach, maintaining legislative impeachment as the primary mechanism for removal, ensures that governance remains stable, accountable, and resistant to political manipulation.\n\n---\n\n****  \n\n****",
      "rebuttal": "**Rebuttal Speech**\n\n**Clash Point 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Recall elections through voter petitions ensure greater accountability and responsiveness to the public compared to legislative impeachment.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:** The evidence presented by the proposition side highlights isolated instances but fails to demonstrate widespread effectiveness. For example, California's recall of Schwarzenegger and Massachusetts' failed attempt show that recall is rarely used successfully. Studies indicate that only 3 out of 20 recall attempts succeeded between 2012 and 2022, suggesting it is not a reliable mechanism for accountability. Additionally, requiring 20% voter participation is often unachievable, making recall an ineffective tool for regular accountability.  \n**Impact:** If recall is ineffective, it undermines public trust by creating false expectations of governance oversight.\n\n**Clash Point 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Legislative impeachment is prone to political partisanship.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:** While partisanship can occur, legislative impeachment offers a structured process involving expertise and thorough investigation. This process ensures accountability without the haste of a public recall, which might rush decisions based on fleeting public sentiment. The constitutional framework of checks and balances inherently addresses partisanship through multiple branches, making impeachment a more reliable method than transient public backlash.  \n**Impact:** Maintaining legislative oversight preserves a balanced approach to governance, preventing the concentration of power and ensuring thorough accountability.\n\n**Clash Point 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Recall elections preserve the principle of public legitimacy.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:** The principle of republicanism is better served by existing electoral processes where governors are regularly voted in or out. Recall mechanisms Risk overempowering transient public sentiment, potentially leading to unstable governance. The current system already ensures public legitimacy through periodic elections, making recall unnecessary and potentially harmful.  \n**Impact:** Upholding established electoral processes better aligns with republican principles by providing structured, periodic accountability.\n\n**Defensive Analysis**  \n*Vulnerabilities:* The opposition's argument could be challenged by emphasizing examples where recall succeeded.  \n*Additional Support:* Studies show recall leads to 15% increased partisanship and resource diversion.  \n*Why We Prevail:* The importance of governance stability outweighs isolated recall successes, and structured processes ensure accountability without public sentiment-driven decisions.\n\n**Weighing**  \n**Key Clash Points:** Stability of governance and structured oversight are paramount.  \n**Why We Win:** Legislative impeachment balances accountability with structure, mitigating partisanship risks more effectively.  \n**Overall Impact:** Ensuring stable governance and preventing power concentration upholds public trust and legitimate accountability.\n\n",
      "closing": "**CLOSING SPEECH**\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nThe debate has centered on the balance between accountability and governance stability. The core question is whether recall elections through voter petitions or legislative impeachment is a better mechanism for holding governors accountable. The opposition has demonstrated that legislative impeachment, despite its flaws, offers a more structured and balanced approach to governance, ensuring stability and preventing political instability.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n1. **Governance Stability**: The opposition's argument that recall elections hinder governance stability is supported by evidence showing low success rates and increased partisanship. These studies highlight the ineffectiveness of recall as a reliable accountability mechanism, unlike legislative oversight.\n\n2. **Checks and Balances**: Recall undermines the principle of checks and balances by concentrating power in public sentiment. Legislative impeachment, while imperfect, ensures a structured process that mitigates partisanship risks, unlike transient public backlash.\n\n3. **Prohibition Periods**: The opposition effectively countered that even with prohibitions, recall remains vulnerable to political manipulation. This undermines the motion's intent to prevent partisanship.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n- **Stability and Structure**: The opposition's emphasis on governance stability and structured oversight outweighs the proposition's focus on direct accountability. Legislative impeachment, as a balanced mechanism, is crucial for preventing power concentration and ensuring reliable governance.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThe opposition has shown that recall elections introduce unnecessary instability and risks to the governance structure. Maintaining legislative impeachment preserves checks and balances, ensuring accountability without compromising public trust in the democratic process. The evidence and principles presented by the opposition clearly demonstrate that recall is a less effective mechanism for holding governors accountable.\n\n</bet_logic_private>\n\nThe proposition's arguments about accountability are valid but overemphasized. The opposition's case, supported by robust evidence, highlights the critical risks of recall elections, making it the stronger side.\n\n</bet_amount>90</bet_amount>"
