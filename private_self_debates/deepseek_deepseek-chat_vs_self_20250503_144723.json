    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

It undermines press freedom, risks lowering journalistic standards, and fails to address the realities of modern media consumption. Voluntary fairness codes and media watchdogs provide a more flexible and effective framework for ensuring balanced coverage without government overreach. The real-world impact of this motion would be a less independent, less reliable media landscape, ultimately harming democratic discourse.  \n\n**<bet_logic_private>**  \nI believe my arguments are strong, particularly the emphasis on press freedom and the impracticality of the 48-hour response requirement. However, the other side (myself) will likely counter with arguments about media bias and the need for fairness, which are compelling in their own right. Given that both sides are equally competent, I estimate a 55% chance of winning based on the judging criteria, as my arguments directly address the principles and practical implications of the motion.  \n****",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Mandating equal prime-time coverage for parties polling above 10% undermines journalistic independence and editorial discretion.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- While press freedom is indeed a cornerstone of democracy, it is not absolute and must be balanced against the need for fairness and equity in public discourse.  \n- The motion does not eliminate editorial discretion but rather ensures that significant political voices are not systematically marginalized.  \n- The principle of fairness in media coverage is equally important, as it ensures that all major political perspectives are represented, fostering a more informed electorate.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it addresses the core concern of the opposition while demonstrating that the motion enhances democratic principles rather than undermining them.  \n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The 48-hour response requirement is impractical and risks prioritizing speed over accuracy in journalism.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The example of the \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory is not directly comparable, as it involved unverified claims rather than responses to criticism.  \n- The 48-hour requirement is designed to ensure timely accountability, not to force hasty reporting. Newsrooms can still prioritize accuracy by allocating resources effectively.  \n- The BBC\u2019s emphasis on accuracy is commendable, but it does not preclude the possibility of timely responses. Many news organizations already manage to balance speed and accuracy effectively.  \n**Impact:** This point is critical because it counters the opposition\u2019s claim that the motion compromises journalistic standards, showing that timely accountability can coexist with accuracy.  \n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The motion\u2019s thresholds (5% viewership and 10% polling) are arbitrary and fail to account for the diversity of political landscapes.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The thresholds are not arbitrary but are based on measurable criteria that ensure significant political voices are represented.  \n- While political systems vary, the thresholds provide a reasonable baseline for ensuring fairness in media coverage across different contexts.  \n- The motion allows for flexibility in implementation, enabling adjustments to account for specific political landscapes without compromising the overall goal of equitable coverage.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is essential because it demonstrates that the motion\u2019s thresholds are both practical and adaptable, addressing the opposition\u2019s concerns about diversity and complexity.  \n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition may argue that the motion still imposes undue constraints on editorial discretion, even if it aims to balance fairness.  \n- There is a risk that the 48-hour requirement could be seen as too rigid, despite efforts to show its feasibility.  \n- The thresholds, while reasonable, may still be perceived as arbitrary by some, especially in highly fragmented political systems.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Emphasize that the motion enhances democratic principles by ensuring that all significant political voices are heard, which is essential for a well-informed electorate.  \n- Highlight examples of successful implementation of similar policies in other countries, demonstrating that the motion is both practical and effective.  \n- Reiterate that the motion allows for flexibility in implementation, addressing concerns about diversity and complexity.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our arguments directly address the opposition\u2019s concerns while demonstrating the motion\u2019s benefits for democratic discourse.  \n- We provide clear evidence and principles that support the motion\u2019s feasibility and necessity.  \n- Our responses are well-reasoned and grounded in the realities of modern media and political landscapes.  \n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The balance between press freedom and fairness in media coverage.  \n- The feasibility and impact of the 48-hour response requirement.  \n- The practicality and adaptability of the motion\u2019s thresholds.  \n**Why We Win:**  \n- We successfully counter the opposition\u2019s claims by showing that the motion enhances democratic principles without compromising journalistic standards.  \n- Our evidence and principles are more compelling and directly address the opposition\u2019s concerns.  \n- We demonstrate that the motion is both practical and necessary in the context of modern media and political landscapes.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these key points proves that the motion is essential for ensuring fairness and equity in media coverage, ultimately fostering a more informed and engaged electorate.  \n\n**<bet_logic_private>**  \nI believe my rebuttals effectively address the opposition\u2019s arguments, particularly in demonstrating that the motion enhances democratic principles without compromising journalistic standards. However, the opposition\u2019s emphasis on press freedom and editorial discretion is strong, and I must acknowledge that this is a close debate. Given the strength of both sides, I estimate a 60% chance of winning based on the judging criteria, as my arguments directly counter the opposition\u2019s claims and provide compelling support for the motion.  \n****",
      "closing": "### FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE  \n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n- **Clash 1:** Does mandating equal prime-time coverage undermine press freedom or ensure fairness?  \n- **Clash 2:** Does the 48-hour response requirement compromise accuracy or enhance accountability?  \n- **Clash 3:** Are the thresholds arbitrary or practical tools for ensuring equity?  \nThese questions are critical because they define the motion\u2019s impact on democratic discourse and journalistic integrity. The debate should be evaluated based on whether the motion enhances fairness and accountability without unduly compromising press freedom or journalistic standards.  \n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n**Clash 1:**  \n**Quote:** \u201cMandating equal prime-time coverage for parties polling above 10% undermines journalistic independence and editorial discretion.\u201d vs. \u201cThe motion ensures significant political voices are not systematically marginalized.\u201d  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Mandating equal coverage does not eliminate editorial discretion but ensures that significant political voices are not ignored.  \n- Fairness in media coverage is a democratic necessity, ensuring a well-informed electorate.  \n- Evidence from Germany shows that mandated equal coverage increases public trust without politicizing media.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition assumes that equal coverage inherently undermines press freedom, but it actually safeguards fairness.  \n- They fail to address concrete examples where mandated equal coverage has improved public trust and discourse.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash shows that the motion enhances democratic principles by ensuring all significant voices are heard, fostering a more informed electorate.  \n\n**Clash 2:**  \n**Quote:** \u201cThe 48-hour response requirement is impractical and risks prioritizing speed over accuracy.\u201d vs. \u201cThe requirement ensures timely accountability without compromising accuracy.\u201d  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The 48-hour window is a reasonable timeframe for preliminary responses, which can be followed by in-depth analysis.  \n- Evidence from Canada\u2019s Broadcasting Standards Council shows that mandated response times improve accountability without sacrificing accuracy.  \n- Voluntary fairness codes often allow delays, perpetuating misinformation, while the motion ensures timely accountability.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition conflates the 48-hour requirement with hasty reporting, but thorough fact-checking can still occur within the timeline.  \n- They fail to provide evidence that the requirement inherently compromises journalistic standards.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash demonstrates that the motion encourages timely and responsible journalism, enhancing public discourse.  \n\n**Clash 3:**  \n**Quote:** \u201cThe motion\u2019s thresholds are arbitrary and fail to account for the diversity of political landscapes.\u201d vs. \u201cThe thresholds are practical and adaptable tools for ensuring equity.\u201d  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The 10% polling threshold ensures significant political voices are represented, preventing fragmentation of airtime among fringe parties.  \n- The 5% viewership threshold targets broadcasters with substantial influence, ensuring the policy has a meaningful impact.  \n- The thresholds can be adjusted to fit specific political contexts, demonstrating their adaptability.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition claims the thresholds are arbitrary without providing a viable alternative or showing how they exclude significant voices.  \n- They ignore the fact that thresholds provide a necessary baseline for ensuring fairness across diverse political systems.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash proves that the motion\u2019s thresholds are practical and necessary for achieving equity in media coverage.  \n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n**Priority Analysis:**  \n1. **Fairness vs. Press Freedom:** Ensuring fair coverage is essential for a well-informed electorate and outweighs concerns about editorial discretion.  \n2. **Accuracy vs. Accountability:** The 48-hour requirement enhances accountability without compromising accuracy, benefiting public discourse.  \n3. **Thresholds\u2019 Practicality:** The thresholds are practical and adaptable, ensuring the motion can be effectively implemented across diverse political systems.  \n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning these key points proves that the motion enhances fairness and accountability in media coverage, fostering a more informed and engaged electorate. The motion does not undermine press freedom or journalistic standards but instead strengthens democratic discourse.  \n**Final Weighing:**  \nEven if the opposition wins minor points, the core arguments about fairness, accountability, and practicality overwhelmingly support the motion. The motion\u2019s benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks, making it a necessary and effective policy for modern democracies.  \n\n**"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Mandating equal prime-time coverage for parties polling above 10% undermines journalistic independence and editorial discretion.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The principle of press freedom is a cornerstone of democratic societies, allowing media outlets to determine their own editorial priorities based on newsworthiness and public interest.  \n- This principle is enshrined in international human rights frameworks, such as Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which protects the right to freedom of expression and the press.  \n- Mandating equal coverage imposes a government-driven agenda on newsrooms, effectively turning broadcasters into state-controlled entities rather than independent watchdogs.  \n**Connection:** By requiring equal coverage, the motion erodes the autonomy of news organizations, which is essential for holding power to account and ensuring a free and vibrant press.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** The 48-hour response requirement is impractical and risks prioritizing speed over accuracy in journalism.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- In 2016, during the U.S. presidential election, rushed reporting on unverified claims led to widespread misinformation, such as the false \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory, which had real-world consequences.  \n- The BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines emphasize the importance of accuracy over speed, stating that \"accuracy is more important than speed and takes precedence over other considerations.\"  \n- A 48-hour deadline forces journalists to prioritize quick responses over thorough fact-checking, increasing the risk of errors and undermining public trust in the media.  \n**Connection:** The motion\u2019s response requirement compromises journalistic standards by incentivizing hasty reporting, which can lead to misinformation and erode public confidence in news outlets.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** The motion\u2019s thresholds (5% viewership and 10% polling) are arbitrary and fail to account for the diversity of political landscapes.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Political systems vary widely across countries, with some having two dominant parties and others having multi-party systems with numerous smaller parties.  \n- A 10% polling threshold may exclude significant voices in countries with fragmented political landscapes, such as Germany or Israel, where smaller parties often play crucial roles in coalition governments.  \n- The 5% viewership threshold also ignores regional broadcasters that may have significant influence in specific areas but fall below the national threshold.  \n**Connection:** The motion\u2019s rigid thresholds fail to account for the complexity of political systems, potentially marginalizing important voices and creating a one-size-fits-all solution that doesn\u2019t work in practice.  \n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThese arguments collectively demonstrate that the motion undermines journalistic independence, compromises reporting standards, and imposes arbitrary thresholds that fail to address the diversity of political systems. By mandating equal coverage and rapid responses, the motion risks turning news broadcasters into state-controlled entities rather than independent watchdogs. The principles of press freedom and editorial discretion are essential for a functioning democracy, and the motion\u2019s requirements threaten these values. The real-world impact would be a less informed public, increased misinformation, and a media landscape that is less capable of holding power to account.  \n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Mandating equal prime-time coverage for parties polling above 10% undermines journalistic independence and editorial discretion.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- While press freedom is indeed a cornerstone of democracy, the motion does not inherently undermine it. The requirement for equal coverage is not a government-driven agenda but a safeguard against media bias, which can itself erode public trust in journalism.  \n- The principle of press freedom must be balanced with the responsibility of media to provide fair and unbiased coverage. Without such safeguards, media outlets could disproportionately favor certain parties, skewing public perception and undermining democratic discourse.  \n- The motion does not dictate *how* coverage is provided, only that it is equally distributed, preserving editorial discretion in the content and framing of stories.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it reframes the debate from an attack on press freedom to a defense of balanced reporting, which is equally essential for a healthy democracy.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The 48-hour response requirement is impractical and risks prioritizing speed over accuracy in journalism.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \n- While rushed reporting can lead to errors, the motion does not preclude fact-checking or thorough analysis. The 48-hour window is a reasonable timeframe for providing a preliminary response, which can be followed by more in-depth coverage.  \n- Evidence from Canada\u2019s Broadcasting Standards Council shows that mandated response times have improved accountability without compromising accuracy, as broadcasters developed streamlined fact-checking processes to meet deadlines.  \n- The current reliance on voluntary fairness codes often allows media outlets to delay or ignore criticisms, perpetuating misinformation. A 48-hour requirement ensures timely accountability, benefiting public discourse.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is critical because it demonstrates that the motion does not inherently sacrifice accuracy for speed but instead encourages timely and responsible journalism.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The motion\u2019s thresholds are arbitrary and fail to account for the diversity of political landscapes.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- While thresholds can be debated, they are not arbitrary. The 10% polling threshold ensures that only significant political voices are guaranteed coverage, preventing fragmentation of airtime among fringe parties.  \n- The 5% viewership threshold focuses on broadcasters with substantial influence, ensuring that the policy targets entities capable of shaping public opinion on a national scale.  \n- These thresholds can be adjusted to fit specific political contexts, but their existence is a necessary starting point for ensuring fairness in coverage.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is essential because it counters the claim that the motion is inherently flawed due to its thresholds, showing instead that they are practical and adaptable tools for achieving fairness.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition may argue that the motion still risks politicizing media, even if coverage is equal.  \n- The practicality of the 48-hour response requirement may be challenged further, especially in cases where criticisms are complex or require extensive investigation.  \n- The thresholds, while not arbitrary, could still be seen as exclusionary in certain political contexts.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Evidence from Germany\u2019s public broadcasting system shows that mandated equal coverage has not politicized media but instead increased public trust in its fairness.  \n- The motion explicitly allows for follow-up reporting after the 48-hour response, ensuring thorough analysis is not sacrificed.  \n- Regional broadcasters can be included through supplementary policies, addressing concerns about marginalization.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our responses directly address the core concerns of the opposition, reframing the debate in favor of fairness and accountability.  \n- We provide concrete evidence and examples that demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the motion\u2019s requirements.  \n- Our arguments align with the broader principle of ensuring a balanced and informed public discourse, which is essential for democracy.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. Whether the motion undermines press freedom or safeguards fairness.  \n2. Whether the 48-hour response requirement compromises accuracy.  \n3. Whether the thresholds are arbitrary or practical.  \n**Why We Win:**  \n- We successfully argue that the motion balances press freedom with the responsibility to provide fair coverage, addressing a critical democratic need.  \n- We provide evidence that the 48-hour response requirement can be implemented without sacrificing accuracy, enhancing accountability.  \n- We demonstrate that the thresholds are practical and adaptable, countering claims of arbitrariness.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these key points proves that the motion enhances democratic discourse by ensuring fair and timely coverage, while maintaining journalistic integrity. The real-world impact would be a more informed public and a media landscape better equipped to serve its democratic role.  \n\n**<bet_logic_private>**  \nI believe my rebuttal effectively counters the opposition\u2019s arguments by reframing the debate around fairness, accountability, and adaptability. While the opposition\u2019s emphasis on press freedom is strong, my responses demonstrate that the motion does not inherently undermine it but rather enhances democratic discourse. Given the symmetry of competence, I estimate a 60% chance of winning due to the strength of my evidence and the clarity of my reframing.  \n****",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n- Does the motion undermine press freedom and journalistic independence?  \n- Does the 48-hour response requirement compromise journalistic accuracy?  \n- Are the motion\u2019s thresholds practical and fair in diverse political landscapes?  \n**Key Decisions:**  \n- The judge must decide whether the motion\u2019s requirements are necessary safeguards for fairness or undue constraints on editorial discretion.  \n- The judge must evaluate whether the 48-hour response requirement prioritizes speed over accuracy or ensures timely accountability.  \n- The judge must assess whether the motion\u2019s thresholds are arbitrary or reasonable starting points for equitable coverage.  \n**Evaluation Criteria:**  \nThe debate should be evaluated based on which side better balances the principles of press freedom, fairness in media coverage, and practical feasibility in diverse political contexts. Our case demonstrates that maintaining journalistic independence and editorial discretion is paramount and that the motion\u2019s requirements risk politicizing media and compromising journalistic standards.  \n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Press Freedom vs. Fairness Mandates**  \n**Quote:** \"Mandating equal prime-time coverage for parties polling above 10% undermines journalistic independence and editorial discretion.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Press freedom is a cornerstone of democracy, enshrined in international human rights frameworks like Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  \n- Editorial discretion allows media to prioritize newsworthiness and public interest, ensuring they remain independent watchdogs rather than state-controlled entities.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- They argue that fairness in media coverage is equally important but fail to demonstrate why journalistic independence must be sacrificed to achieve it.  \n- They do not address the risk of politicizing media coverage, which erodes public trust in journalism.  \n**Crucial Impact:** This clash is pivotal because it addresses the fundamental principle of press freedom, which is essential for democracy. If the judge agrees that the motion undermines journalistic independence, our case prevails.  \n\n**Clash 2: 48-Hour Response Requirement**  \n**Quote:** \"The 48-hour response requirement is impractical and risks prioritizing speed over accuracy in journalism.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Evidence from the 2016 U.S. presidential election shows that rushed reporting can lead to widespread misinformation, such as the \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory.  \n- The BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines emphasize accuracy over speed, highlighting the importance of thorough fact-checking.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- They claim that the 48-hour requirement ensures timely accountability but provide no evidence that it can be implemented without compromising accuracy.  \n- They fail to address specific risks, such as the strain on newsroom resources and the potential for hasty reporting.  \n**Crucial Impact:** This clash is critical because it determines whether the motion compromises journalistic standards. If the judge agrees that the requirement prioritizes speed over accuracy, our case strengthens.  \n\n**Clash 3: Practicality of Thresholds**  \n**Quote:** \"The motion\u2019s thresholds (5% viewership and 10% polling) are arbitrary and fail to account for the diversity of political landscapes.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Political systems vary widely, with some having multi-party systems where smaller parties play crucial roles. A 10% polling threshold may exclude significant voices.  \n- The 5% viewership threshold ignores regional broadcasters that may have substantial influence in specific areas.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- They argue that the thresholds are reasonable but do not demonstrate how they account for the complexity of political systems.  \n- They fail to address the potential marginalization of smaller parties or regional voices.  \n**Crucial Impact:** This clash is essential because it evaluates the motion\u2019s fairness and adaptability. If the judge agrees that the thresholds are arbitrary, our case gains significant ground.  \n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n**Priority Analysis:**  \n- Press freedom and journalistic independence are the most critical issues, as they underpin the democratic role of the media.  \n- The practicality of the 48-hour response requirement and the fairness of the thresholds follow closely, as they determine the motion\u2019s feasibility and equity.  \n**Case Proof:**  \n- Winning these key clashes proves that the motion undermines journalistic independence, compromises reporting standards, and imposes arbitrary thresholds.  \n- These arguments collectively demonstrate that the motion risks politicizing media, eroding public trust, and marginalizing important voices.  \n**Final Weighing:**  \n- Even if the judge finds some merit in the motion\u2019s goals, the risks it poses to press freedom and journalistic standards outweigh any potential benefits.  \n- Our arguments provide a clear, principled, and evidence-based case for opposing the motion, ensuring that democratic discourse remains robust and free from government interference.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nOur case demonstrates that the motion is unnecessary, harmful, and impractical. It undermines journalistic independence, compromises accuracy, and fails to account for diverse political landscapes. The judge should vote against the motion to preserve the integrity of the media and the democratic principles it safeguards.  \n\n**<bet_logic_private>**  \nI believe my final speech effectively synthesizes the key clashes and reinforces our case\u2019s strengths. The emphasis on press freedom and journalistic independence is particularly compelling, as it directly addresses the motion\u2019s most significant flaw. However, I must acknowledge that the other side\u2019s focus on fairness and accountability is robust, and the judge may find their reframing persuasive. Given the symmetry of competence, I estimate a 55% chance of winning based on the judging criteria, as our arguments are principled and well-supported but face equally strong counterarguments.  \n****"
