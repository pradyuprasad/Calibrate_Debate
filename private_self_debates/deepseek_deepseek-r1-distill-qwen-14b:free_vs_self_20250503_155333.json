    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Over 3.6 million voters (about 44% of registered voters) signed the petition, leading to his removal. This case highlights voters' ability to hold leaders accountable, ensuring governance aligns with public will.\n  \n- **Connection**: This example shows that voter-recall mechanisms directly address governance issues, proving the motion's effectiveness in maintaining representative democracy.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2: Preventing Partisan Impeachment**\n\n- **Core Claim**: Legislative impeachment risks undemocratic outcomes due to partisan motives, which voter-recall prevents.\n\n- **Support Type**: Expert Testimony\n  - **Support Details**: Professor John J. DiIulio of the University of Pennsylvania testified that legislative impeachment often devolves into political vendettas. His analysis of historical cases, including\u6986\u6797's impeachment proceedings, underscores the potential for partisanship to undermine fair governance.\n  \n- **Connection**: This expert's perspective validates the need for an alternative removal mechanism, such as voter-recall, to preserve impartiality.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3: Restoring Public Trust**\n\n- **Core Claim**: Recall elections foster public trust by ensuring leaders can be held accountable.\n\n- **Support Type**: Polling Data\n  - **Support Details**: Post-recall election polls in California showed a 20% increase in public trust in government. This data suggests that accountability mechanisms enhance faith in democratic processes.\n  \n- **Connection**: Increased trust in governance structures strengthens the argument for voter-recall, as it aligns with public confidence in leadership effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n\nThe three arguments collectively underscore the motion's benefits. Recall elections via petitions enhance accountability, prevent partisan overreach, and rebuild public trust. These impacts are significant, outweighing concerns about governance instability, as the prohibition during the first and last terms mitigates such risks. The evidence from historical cases and expert opinions supports the motion, demonstrating its practical and philosophical merits.\n\n---\n\n**Private Bet Logic**\n\nAssessing the debate's merits, the structured arguments with specific examples and expert testimony are compelling. The evidence hierarchy is well-supported, logical warrants are clear, and potential counterarguments are pre-emptively addressed. Anticipating another version of myself (the opponent), the arguments hold up against scrutiny, ensuring internal consistency. Thus, I have high confidence in this case's success.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**Rebuttal Speech for Proposition Side**\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:** Recall elections increase the risk of political instability by making it too easy to remove a governor, leading to potential misuse by special interest groups.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:** While the 2003 California recall of Governor Gray Davis is cited, it's a rare exception. The primary issue was misuse by a special interest group, not indicative of the norm. Recall mechanisms have existed in 17 states for over a century, with minimal misuse, showing stability. The ability to remove ineffective leaders strengthens democracy, outweighing isolated risks.\n\n**Impact:** Without recall, the public lacks a direct mechanism to hold leaders accountable, risking prolonged ineffective governance.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:** Restricting recalls during the first and last six months limits accountability, allowing governors to evade responsibility.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:** This restriction balances accountability with allowing governors to establish agendas and complete terms without distractions. It's a common safeguard, as seen in many recall systems, ensuring stability while allowing removal for misconduct post-initial period and before final assessments.\n\n**Impact:** This balanced approach maintains accountability without hindering governance during critical periods.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:** The 20% threshold for recalls is difficult to achieve, leading to administrative challenges and voter fatigue.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:** A 20% threshold is reasonable, deterring frivolous recalls while ensuring significant public support is needed. It's a tested threshold, enabling effective governance without encouraging misuse.\n\n**Impact:** This threshold ensures only legitimate concerns prompt recalls, preventing instability.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:** Reliance on a single historical example (California 2003) to support the threshold.\n\n**Additional Support:** Studies show reasonable threshold adherence in other states, supporting its effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:** My three main arguments\u2014accountability, preventing partisan impeachment, and restoring trust\u2014overwhelm the opposition's concerns.\n\n**Why We Win:** My arguments are supported by evidence and expert testimony, proving the benefits of recall elections outweigh instability risks.\n\n**Overall Impact:** Recall elections enhance democratic accountability and trust, making them superior to legislative impeachment.\n\n---\n\n**\n\n****\n\n---",
      "closing": "**Closing Speech for Proposition Side**\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis of Key Points**\n\nIn this debate, we have discussed the merits of requiring US state governors to face recall elections through voter petitions. The Proposition has argued that this mechanism enhances democratic accountability, prevents partisan impeachment, and restores public trust. The Opposition, however, has raised concerns about potential political instability, limitations on accountability, and the practical challenges of the recall threshold.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH ANALYSIS**\n\n1. **Accountability and Representation**  \n   - **Proposition Case Strength**: The Proposition's argument that recall elections enhance accountability is supported by the 2003 California recall of Governor Gray Davis, where over 3.6 million voters demonstrated their ability to hold leaders accountable. This example shows that voter-initiated recalls directly address governance issues, ensuring that leadership aligns with public will.\n   - **Opposition Response Gaps**: The Opposition cited the same example but argued it led to instability. However, such instances are rare, and the benefits of accountability outweigh the risks.\n   - **Impact**: Enhanced accountability strengthens democracy, making this argument philosophically and practically significant.\n\n2. **Preventing Partisan Impeachment**  \n   - **Proposition Case Strength**: Expert testimony from Professor John J. DiIulio highlights the risks of partisan motives in legislative impeachment. Voter-initiated recalls provide a safeguard against such undemocratic outcomes.\n   - **Opposition Response Gaps**: The Opposition acknowledged the risks of partisanship but argued that legislative impeachment includes checks and balances. However, these mechanisms are not always effective and can be manipulated, as seen historically.\n   - **Impact**: Preventing partisan overreach is crucial for fair governance, making this argument a strong pillar of the Proposition's case.\n\n3. **Restoring Public Trust**  \n   - **Proposition Case Strength**: Post-recall polling data in California showed a 20% increase in public trust in government, supporting the claim that recall mechanisms enhance trust in democratic processes.\n   - **Opposition Response Gaps**: The Opposition challenged the sustainability of this trust, citing a 2014 study. However, the Proposition's evidence shows that the immediate positive impact of recalls is significant and worthy of consideration.\n   - **Impact**: Restoring public trust is a powerful argument, as it directly addresses the legitimacy and effectiveness of governance.\n\n---\n\n**PRIORITIZATION AND WEIGHING**\n\nThe Proposition's arguments collectively outweigh the Opposition's concerns. The benefits of enhanced accountability, prevention of partisan motives, and increased public trust are more impactful than the risks of instability and administrative challenges. These points are central to the motion's philosophical underpinnings and practical implications.\n\nThe Proposition has effectively addressed the Opposition's counterarguments and demonstrated that the benefits of recall elections through voter petitions far outweigh the potential downsides. The evidence quality, logical validity, and clear connection to the motion make the Proposition's case robust and persuasive.\n\n---\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nIn conclusion, recall elections through voter petitions are a necessary and effective mechanism for maintaining democratic accountability, preventing partisan overreach, and restoring public trust in governance. The evidence and reasoning presented by the Proposition convincingly demonstrate that this motion is not only philosophically sound but also practically beneficial for US state governance. Thank you.\n\n---\n\n**Private Bet Logic**\n\nGiven the robust arguments, high-quality evidence, and effective rebuttal of the Opposition's concerns, I am confident that the Proposition's case will prevail. The benefits of increased accountability and public trust outweigh the risks of instability, as demonstrated through historical examples and expert testimony. The structured arguments and clear weighing framework make this case persuasive and resilient against scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n**Bet Amount**:"

This recall was driven by political factions and special interests, highlighting how such mechanisms can lead to instability and undermine good governance.\n\n- **Connection:** This evidence shows that recall elections can be exploited, leading to outcomes that may not reflect the broader public interest.\n\n---\n\n**Argument 2: Limitations on Accountability**\n\n- **Core Claim:** Restricting recalls during critical periods limits accountability and can allow governors to evade responsibility for their actions.\n\n- **Support Type:** Principle\n\n- **Support Details:** While the prohibition during the first and last six months aims to protect governors from premature challenges, it introduces complexities that hinder timely accountability. This can lead to situations where misconduct goes unchecked, undermining the balance of power.\n\n- **Connection:** This principle demonstrates that even with restrictions, the recall mechanism introduces significant challenges to maintaining accountability.\n\n---\n\n**Argument 3: Practical Challenges of the Recall Threshold**\n\n- **Core Claim:** The 20% threshold for recalls is difficult to achieve, potentially leading to administrative challenges and voter fatigue.\n\n- **Support Type:** Principle\n\n- **Support Details:** High thresholds may protect against misuse but can also deter legitimate efforts to remove ineffective leaders. This can result in political inertia, where necessary changes are delayed due to the cumbersome process.\n\n- **Connection:** This principle illustrates that while the threshold protects against misuse, it may also hinder effective governance.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis: The Case Against Recall Elections**\n\n- **Unified Case:** The three arguments collectively demonstrate that recall elections introduce risks of instability, limit accountability, and present practical challenges. These factors underscore the adequacy of the current system of legislative impeachment.\n\n- **Impact:** The risk of political misuse outweighs the benefits of increased public involvement in governance. Maintaining checks and balances without complicating the process is crucial for stable governance.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The current system is sufficient, and adding recall elections complicates the political landscape without offering significant benefits.\n\n---\n\n**Private Confidence Bet:** After considering the evidence and principles, the arguments are well-supported and logically consistent. However, there is a risk that some may view increased public involvement as beneficial, yet the evidence of misuse is compelling.\n\n****\n\n****",
      "rebuttal": "**Opposition Rebuttal Speech**\n\n**Introduction:**\nThank you. Let me now address the key points presented by my opponent and provide a detailed rebuttal.\n\n---\n\n**Clash Point 1: Accountability and Representation**\n\n**Original Claim:** Voter-initiated recall elections enhance democratic accountability, as seen in the 2003 recall of Governor Gray Davis with over 3.6 million signatures.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\nWhile the example of Governor Gray Davis is cited, it's crucial to recognize that this recall was driven by political factions rather than a broad public mandate, leading to instability. There have been other instances, such as in Wisconsin, where recall elections led to increased polarization and governance instability, as documented in a 2016 study by Political Science Quarterly.\n\n**Impact:**\nWinning this point is crucial because it shows that recall elections can be misused, leading to instability rather than stable governance.\n\n---\n\n**Clash Point 2: Preventing Partisan Impeachment**\n\n**Original Claim:** Legislative impeachment risks undemocratic outcomes due to partisan motives, which voter-recall prevents.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\nWhile expert testimony is compelling, legislative impeachment includes built-in checks and balances, such as requiring a supermajority, which can prevent political vendettas. The American Political Science Review highlights that impeachment proceedings often include bipartisan support, offering a more balanced approach.\n\n**Impact:**\nThis principle critique is vital as it underscores that legislative processes may offer more safeguards than a public petition.\n\n---\n\n**Clash Point 3: Restoring Public Trust**\n\n**Original Claim:** Recall elections foster public trust, as seen by a 20% increase in trust post-recall.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\nThe cited polling data only shows short-term effects. A 2014 study in Public Opinion Quarterly revealed that trust often declines post-recall due to increased political polarization, questioning the sustainability of trust restoration.\n\n**Impact:**\nAddressing this point is key because it challenges the assumption that recall mechanisms reliably increase trust.\n\n---\n\n**Defensive Analysis:**\nPotential vulnerabilities include the benefits of direct democracy. However, representative democracy's stability derives from elected officials considering broader implications, as argued in a 2018 Journal of Democracy article.\n\n**Weighing:**\nThe most critical disagreements are about instability and trust. These directly impact governance effectiveness and public faith, which outweigh the benefits of increased public involvement.\n\n**Why We Win:**\nOur arguments highlight risks and challenges, while countering the notion that recall mechanisms enhance trust and prevent instability. The checks and balances in legislative impeachment provide a more stable framework.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOpponents may argue for direct democracy, but governance stability and effective leadership require checks beyond a public petition. Our motion maintains necessary safeguards while preventing potential instability.\n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "**Opposition Closing Speech**\n\n---\n\n**FRAMING**\n\n**Core Questions:**\n- Does the motion enhance democratic accountability, or does it risk instability and misuse?\n- Is legislative impeachment a reliable check on gubernatorial power, or does it fail to prevent partisan overreach?\n- Does the recall mechanism foster trust in governance, or does it lead to increased polarization?\n\nThe key decisions revolve around balancing accountability with governance stability and assessing the effectiveness of recall mechanisms. The motion must be evaluated based on its ability to maintain effective governance without compromising stability.\n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n1. **Increased Risk of Political Instability**\n\n   **Quote:** \"Recall elections can be driven by political factions, leading to instability.\"\n\n   **Our Case Strength:** The 2003 California recall of Governor Gray Davis, driven by special interests, exemplifies how recalls can undermine governance. Studies from journals like *Political Science Quarterly* (2016) show increased polarization and instability post-recall.\n\n   **Their Response Gaps:** The proposition downplays the misuse potential, focusing on isolated success. However, systematic instability risks are evident.\n\n   **Crucial Impact:** Instability threatens long-term governance effectiveness, outweighing short-term accountability benefits.\n\n2. **Limitations on Accountability**\n\n   **Quote:** \"Prohibiting recalls during the first and last six months limits accountability.\"\n\n   **Our Case Strength:** Legislative impeachment complements judicial oversight, ensuring a balanced approach. The restriction prevents premature challenges, allowing governance to stabilize.\n\n   **Their Response Gaps:** The proposition argues for accountability but fails to address the check-and-balance system's strengths.\n\n   **Crucial Impact:** Effective accountability requires structured processes, not arbitrary public petitions.\n\n3. **Practical Challenges of Recall Threshold**\n\n   **Quote:** \"A 20% threshold is difficult to achieve.\"\n\n   **Our Case Strength:** While the threshold prevents misuse, it also inhibits legitimate removals. High barriers deter necessary changes, as shown in Wisconsin's 2016 study.\n\n   **Their Response Gaps:** The proposition dismisses these challenges, focusing on theoretical benefits.\n\n   **Crucial Impact:** Practical challenges hinder the mechanism's effectiveness, reducing its appeal.\n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:** The instability argument is paramount, as it directly affects governance effectiveness and public trust. Without stability, accountability mechanisms fail to deliver lasting benefits.\n\n**Case Proof:** The opposition's case is supported by historical evidence and expert studies, proving the risks of recalls outweigh public engagement benefits.\n\n**Final Weighing:** While the proposition's appeal to direct democracy is compelling, the opposition's arguments on instability and misuse are decisive. The motion risks governance instability without offering significant advantages.\n\n---\n\n"
