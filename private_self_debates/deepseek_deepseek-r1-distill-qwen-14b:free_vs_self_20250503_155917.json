    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "The motion is to debate whether governments should transition their primary role in space from direct operation to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities. I am on the proposition side, so I will argue in favor of the motion. Below is the structured speech I would deliver, followed by my private confidence bet.\n\n---\n\n# STRUCTURED SPEECH\n\n## OPENING SPEECH\n\n## ARGUMENT 1  \n**Core Claim:** Transitioning to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities will foster greater innovation through market competition.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Private sector companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin have demonstrated unprecedented technological advancements and cost reductions. For example, SpaceX successfully developed reusable rockets, reducing launch costs by over 80% since 2010.  \n- According to NASA, public-private partnerships have led to breakthroughs in spacecraft design, such as the Commercial Crew Program, which achieved its first human spaceflight in 2020, accelerating development by several years.  \n**Connection:** These examples show that private companies, driven by competition and innovation, can achieve results faster and more efficiently than government-led initiatives.  \n\n---\n\n## ARGUMENT 2  \n**Core Claim:** Shifting to a regulatory role will allow governments to focus on strategic priorities while reducing financial burden.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The U.S. government has spent over $1.7 trillion on NASA programs since 1958, while private companies like SpaceX and Amazon's Jeff Bezos have invested billions of their own funds in space exploration.  \n- A 2021 study by the Heritage Foundation found that transitioning certain space operations to private companies could reduce taxpayer costs by up to 40%.  \n**Connection:** By transitioning to regulation, governments can redirect resources to other critical areas like national security, education, and infrastructure.  \n\n---\n\n## ARGUMENT 3  \n**Core Claim:** Oversight ensures responsible growth while maintaining global competitiveness.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- A regulatory framework ensures that private space activities align with international norms, safety standards, and environmental protection.  \n- For example, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Commercial Space Transportation oversees launches and reentries, balancing innovation with public safety.  \n- This approach fosters a competitive yet sustainable space economy.  \n**Connection:** A well-designed regulatory regime enables the private sector to thrive while addressing potential risks and ethical concerns.  \n\n---\n\n## SYNTHESIS  \nMy arguments collectively demonstrate that transitioning to regulation and oversight is a strategic, innovative, and cost-effective approach for governments. By leveraging private sector capabilities, governments canFocus on high-priority areas, ensure ethical and safe growth, and foster global competitiveness. This shift not only advances space exploration but also benefits society through economic growth and scientific discovery.  \n\n---\n\n# PRIVATE CONFIDENCE BET (VISIBLE ONLY TO ME)  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n--- \n\nThis is the final answer:  \n****",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:** Transitioning to regulation fosters innovation through market competition, as seen with companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\nWhile the examples of SpaceX and Blue Origin are impressive, they are exceptions, not the rule. Not all government functions can be effectively handed over to the private sector, especially in areas requiring long-term, risky investments. For instance, without sufficient government funding, projects like gravitational wave detection may not receive the necessary investment. Additionally, the private sector's focus on profit can sometimes lead to monopolistic tendencies, stifling competition and innovation. \n\n**Impact:** Recognizing the limitations of private competition is crucial for understanding why a balance between regulation and public investment is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:** Shifting to regulation reduces financial burden, as seen with high government program costs and private investments.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\nThe argument overlooks that many private investments are still supported by government contracts and subsidies, effectively shifting costs rather than reducing them. Furthermore, sunk costs in existing government projects mean that transitioning to regulation may not yield immediate financial benefits. It's essential to consider that some projects require public funds to mitigate high-risk scenarios.\n\n**Impact:** Acknowledging the continued role of public funds is vital for a realistic transition strategy.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:** Regulation ensures responsible growth and prevents monopolies, fostering a sustainable space economy.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\nRegulation alone is insufficient to ensure ethical outcomes. The private sector's pursuit of profit can lead to unethical practices, such as exploiting space resources without regard for sustainability. International cooperation is necessary, and current frameworks may not adequately address these challenges, as seen with varying global standards.\n\n**Impact:** Recognizing the need for more than just regulation underscores the necessity of a multi-faceted approach.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- Reliance on a few companies' success stories may not capture broader market dynamics.  \n- Potential ethical lapses and monopolistic risks need addressing.\n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Emphasize the importance of public goods and long-term investments that private sectors may neglect.  \n- Highlight cases where regulation failed to prevent unethical practices, necessitating a balanced approach.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our analysis shows that a balanced approach leveraging both public and private sectors is more sustainable.  \n- Ethical and sustainable space exploration requires more than just regulation.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The inherent superiority of the private sector is foundational to their arguments but is critiqued for overreach.  \n- The necessity of a balanced approach addresses the financial and ethical concerns effectively.\n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- Our challenge to the private sector's assumed superiority provides a more nuanced perspective.  \n- A balanced approach ensures both innovation and sustainability, making it the stronger framework.\n\n---\n\n**OVERALL IMPACT:**  \nTransitioning to regulation is crucial but must be paired with ongoing public investment and international cooperation. This balanced approach ensures innovation, financial sustainability, and ethical exploration, proving the motion's validity.\n\n---\n\n**\n\n****",
      "closing": "# CLOSING SPEECH\n\n## FRAMING\n\n**Core Questions:**\n- **Innovation vs. Government Dominance:** Should governments prioritize fostering private sector innovation or maintain direct control for continuity and security?\n- **Financial Efficiency:** Is transitioning to regulation a cost-effective strategy, or will it impose hidden financial and strategic costs?\n- **Responsible Growth:** Can government oversight ensure ethical and sustainable space exploration, or is direct involvement necessary to prevent monopolistic practices and environmental harm?\n\n**How to Evaluate:**\nThis debate hinges on the balance between leveraging private sector dynamism and maintaining government oversight to ensure public good and long-term sustainability. The evaluation must weigh the benefits of innovation and efficiency against potential risks like monopolies, ethical lapses, and resource misallocation.\n\n---\n\n## KEY CLASHES\n\n**Clash 1: Innovation Through Competition**\n\n**Opposition Challenge:** The opposition argues that the proposition\u2019s reliance on private sector success stories ignores the critical role of government funding in driving innovation. They claim that cost reductions and advancements are often due to public investments rather than regulatory shifts.\n\n**Proposition Response:**\n- **Our Case Strength:** While government funding is crucial, the private sector\u2019s ability to innovate and compete independently is evident in cases like SpaceX\u2019s reusable rockets and Blue Origin\u2019s suborbital flights. These achievements demonstrate that private enterprise, when given regulatory freedom, can achieve remarkable progress without complete government control.\n- **Their Response Gaps:** The opposition overlooks the broader market competition that drives private companies to innovate. Public-private partnerships, as seen in NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, are a balanced approach where government funding is combined with private efficiency, not a reason to dismiss the benefits of transitioning to regulation.\n- **Crucial Impact:** Innovation is not just about funding but about fostering a competitive environment where companies are incentivized to push boundaries. This transition democratizes space exploration, enabling more actors to contribute, which is essential for sustainable progress.\n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Financial Efficiency and Strategic Focus**\n\n**Opposition Challenge:** The opposition claims that shifting to regulation is not as cost-effective as the proposition suggests, highlighting the complexities and costs involved in creating a regulatory framework and transitioning existing operations.\n\n**Proposition Response:**\n- **Our Case Strength:** While transition costs exist, they are outweighed by long-term savings and the redirection of funds to strategic priorities. Studies like the Heritage Foundation\u2019s indicate significant cost reduction potential through privatization, which can alleviate taxpayer burdens.\n- **Their Response Gaps:** The opposition underestimates the private sector\u2019s ability to absorb operational costs. Companies like Amazon and SpaceX invest billions annually, reducing the need for public funding. Transitioning allows governments to avoid sunk costs in outdated programs and focus on high-priority areas.\n- **Crucial Impact:** Financial sustainability is critical for government resource allocation. Transitioning to regulation aligns financial responsibility with strategic goals, ensuring that public funds are used where they are most needed.\n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Responsible Growth and Global Competitiveness**\n\n**Opposition Challenge:** The opposition warns that a U.S.-centric regulatory framework risks stifling global competition and reducing international cooperation, potentially leading to monopolistic practices.\n\n**Proposition Response:**\n- **Our Case Strength:**Proposed regulatory frameworks are designed to be inclusive, encouraging international collaboration and preventing monopolies. The FAA\u2019s oversight model balances innovation with safety, emphasizing transparency and fairness.\n- **Their Response Gaps:**The opposition does not account for the potential of a multi-lateral regulatory body that could ensure global standards and prevent dominance by a single entity. The private sector\u2019s global nature already drives international collaboration, as seen in partnerships between companies and space agencies worldwide.\n- **Crucial Impact:**Ethical and sustainable growth requires a balanced approach that prevents monopolies and promotes fairness and international collaboration. This ensures that space exploration benefits all nations and humanity as a whole.\n\n---\n\n## VOTING ISSUES\n\n**Priority Analysis:**\n- **Innovation and Competition:** This is the most critical issue, as it directly impacts the pace and direction of space exploration.\n- **Financial Sustainability:** Crucial for ensuring that governments can redirect resources to other priority areas without burdening taxpayers.\n- **Ethical and Sustainable Growth:** Ensures that space exploration aligns with global standards and protects future generations.\n\n**Case Proof:**\n- Winning on innovation proves that private sector competition can drive progress independently.\n- Winning on financial efficiency demonstrates that transitioning to regulation is a fiscally responsible approach.\n- Winning on ethical growth ensures that space exploration is sustainable and benefits society globally.\n\n**Final Weighing:**\n- Even if some arguments are met by the opposition, the proposition\u2019s case on fostering innovation, achieving financial sustainability, and ensuring responsible growth is superior.\n- The motion\u2019s emphasis on transitioning to regulation and oversight strikes the right balance, enabling the private sector to thrive while maintaining government accountability.\n\n---\n\n## SYNTHESIS\nThe arguments presented by the proposition demonstrate that transitioning to regulation and oversight is the most strategic, innovative, and sustainable approach for governments. By fostering competition, reducing financial burden, and ensuring responsible growth, this transition enables private sector excellence while addressing potential risks. The opposition\u2019s arguments, while valid in part, do not undermine the core benefits of the motion. The evidence and principles supporting the proposition provide a clear and compelling path forward, making this motion both necessary and beneficial for the future of space exploration.\n\n---\n\n# PRIVATE CONFIDENCE BET (VISIBLE ONLY TO ME)\n\n\n\n**PROPOSITION CONFIDENCE BET for CLOSING:** Bet amount: 90"

The claim that private sector competition alone fosters innovation ignores the significant role of public funding in these companies' success.  \n- The evidence cited, such as cost reductions, is more due to technological advancements enabled by government research and development rather than the regulatory shift itself.  \n**Impact:** Recognizing the true role of government funding is crucial for understanding whether transitioning to regulation will genuinely foster innovation without relying on public support.  \n\n---\n\n## CLASH POINT 2\n**Original Claim:** Shifting to a regulatory role will allow governments to focus on strategic priorities while reducing financial burden.  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The principle of reducing financial burden overlooks the long-term costs of transitioning infrastructure and expertise. The government still bears the responsibility of creating a regulatory framework, which requires initial investments and ongoing oversight.  \n- The claim that private investments can reduce taxpayer costs is speculative, as space projects often require significant upfront funding that private entities may be reluctant to provide without guaranteed returns.  \n**Impact:** Understanding the full financial implications ensures that the transition is feasible and sustainable.  \n\n---\n\n## CLASH POINT 3\n**Original Claim:** Oversight ensures responsible growth while maintaining global competitiveness.  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The principle of global competitiveness is at risk if the regulatory framework is overly influenced by a single dominant private company, potentially stifling smaller players and reducing diversity in innovation.  \n- The examples cited, such as the FAA's oversight, are U.S.-centric and may not account for the needs of other nations, undermining international cooperation in space activities.  \n**Impact:** A balanced regulatory framework must address global and ethical considerations to truly ensure responsible growth.  \n\n---\n\n## DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The proposition may be vulnerable to arguments about the dependency of private companies on government funding and the potential for reduced accountability under private sector oversight.  \n- The long-term financial benefits of transitioning to regulation are not as clear as the evidence suggests.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Highlighting the importance of government investments in foundational space research, as seen inNASA's role in early space exploration, reinforces the necessity of continued government involvement.  \n- Emphasizing the need for a transitional period to ensure a smooth shift to regulation and avoid service disruptions.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our analysis shows that the proposition underestimates the ongoing role of government funding and the complexities of transitioning to regulation.  \n\n---\n\n## WEIGHING  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The role of government funding in private sector innovation.  \n- The feasibility and financial implications of transitioning to regulation.  \n- The risks of reduced international cooperation under a U.S.-centric regulatory framework.  \n**Why We Win:**  \n- By addressing these points, we demonstrate that government involvement is still necessary for fostering innovation and maintaining global competitiveness.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \n- Winning these points proves that the proposition's case is overstated, showing the importance of a balanced approach that recognizes the continued need for government leadership in space.  \n\n---\n\n## SYNTHESIS  \nOur rebuttals demonstrate that while transitioning to regulation has potential benefits, the proposition's case is overly optimistic and ignores the critical role of government funding, the complexities of transition, and the risks of reduced international cooperation. Recognizing these realities ensures a more realistic and sustainable approach to the future of space activities.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "# CLOSING SPEECH\n\n## FRAMING\n\n**Core Questions:**\n- Should governments transition their role in space to regulation, or should they continue direct operations?\n- How should the debate be evaluated: through innovation, cost-effectiveness, and responsible growth?\n\n## KEY CLASHES\n\n**Clash 1: Innovation Through Competition**\n\n- **Proposition Claim:** Transition fosters innovation via market competition.\n- **Support Strength:** Private companies like SpaceX have achieved remarkable advancements, reducing costs and accelerating development.\n- **Response Gaps:** Overlooks that government funding is crucial for these innovations.\n- **Impact:** Innovation happens, but it's enhanced by regulation, not solely by competition.\n\n**Clash 2: Cost Reduction and Strategic Focus**\n\n- **Proposition Claim:** Transition reduces financial burden.\n- **Support Strength:** Redirects resources to strategic priorities.\n- **Response Gaps:** Transition has complexities and ongoing costs.\n- **Impact:** Strategic focus is valid, but transition isn't a quick fix.\n\n**Clash 3: Responsible Growth and Global Competitiveness**\n\n- **Proposition Claim:** Regulation ensures responsible growth.\n- **Support Strength:** Prevents monopolies, promotes sustainability.\n- **Response Gaps:** Risks of reduced international cooperation.\n- **Impact:** Regulation is essential, but needs global oversight.\n\n## VOTING ISSUES\n\n**Priority Analysis:**\n1. Innovation and cost reduction are foundational but complex.\n2. Responsible growth must address international collaboration.\n\n**Case Proof:**\n- Transition fosters innovation and reduces costs.\n- Regulation ensures responsible growth.\n\n**Final Weighing:**\n- Proposition's concerns are valid but overestimated.\n- Transition's benefits outweigh issues, proving the motion.\n\n---\n\n## SYNTHESIS\n\nThe debate highlights the potential of private innovation and regulation but underestimates complexities. Balancing these, transitioning to regulation supports strategic priorities, fosters innovation, and ensures responsible growth, making the motion valid.\n\n"
