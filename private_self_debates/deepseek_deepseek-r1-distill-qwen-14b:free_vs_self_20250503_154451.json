    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "closing": "**Opposition Closing Speech**\n\n---\n\n**Framing**\n\nThe core questions in this debate are about the balance between ensuring fair coverage for political parties and safeguarding press freedom and editorial independence. The key decisions revolve around the feasibility and desirability of government-imposed regulations versus relying on voluntary fairness codes. The debate should be evaluated based on the impact on press freedom, the practicality of regulations, and the potential consequences for media diversity and quality.\n\n---\n\n**Key Clashes**\n\n1. **Clash on Equal Coverage**\n   - **Opponent's Claim:** \"Equal coverage will ensure fairness and prevent misinformation.\"\n   - **Our Case Strength:** While fairness is a laudable goal, the proposition fails to prove that mandated equal coverage will reduce misinformation. Our evidence, including specific statistics on media diversity, shows that equal coverage can stifle diverse voices and limit broadcasters' ability to provide nuanced reporting. The absence of a direct causal link between equal coverage and reduced misinformation weakens their case.\n   - **Their Response Gaps:** The proposition does not address how equal coverage can lead to homogenization of content, nor do they provide evidence that mandatory coverage will lead to better-informed voters.\n   - **Crucial Impact:** Maintaining editorial independence is essential for a free press, which is foundational to democracy. Without it, the quality and diversity of news reporting are at risk.\n\n2. **Clash on Voluntary Fairness Codes**\n   - **Opponent's Claim:** \"Voluntary fairness codes are ineffective and insufficient.\"\n   - **Our Case Strength:** The proposition overlooks evidence showing that voluntary fairness codes can be effective. For example, studies demonstrate that broadcasters often adhere to these codes to maintain public trust without the need for coercion. Our evidence, supported by expert testimony, highlights the historical success of such codes in promoting balance and fairness.\n   - **Their Response Gaps:** The proposition does not address cases where voluntary codes have worked well, nor do they provide robust evidence of their ineffectiveness.\n   - **Crucial Impact:** Relying on voluntary codes preserves press freedom while still ensuring accountability, making them a better alternative to rigid regulation.\n\n3. **Clash on 48-Hour Response Segments**\n   - **Opponent's Claim:** \"48-hour response segments are feasible and will reduce misinformation.\"\n   - **Our Case Strength:** Our evidence, including specific examples, shows that the 48-hour requirement is too restrictive and can lead to hurried, less accurate responses. Broadcasters need more time to provide thoughtful and accurate rebuttals, as shown in our case study data.\n   - **Their Response Gaps:** The proposition does not consider the practical challenges of implementing a 48-hour response framework, nor do they provide evidence that such a short timeframe is optimal for accurate journalism.\n   - **Crucial Impact:** A rushed response mechanism risks misinformation, undermining the very goal the proposition seeks to achieve.\n\n---\n\n**Voting Issues**\n\n- **Priority Analysis:** The most critical clash is on the importance of press freedom and editorial independence. Without a free press, the quality of news and the diversity of voices are at risk, which are foundational to a democratic society.\n- **Case Proof:** Our case is proven through specific evidence and logical reasoning, linking the importance of press freedom to the broader principles of democracy and the potential harms of overregulation.\n- **Final Weighing:** While the proposition highlights important concerns about fairness, their evidence is weak compared to our arguments about the risks of regulation. The benefits of maintaining a free press outweigh the potential gains from mandated coverage.\n\n---\n\n**Judging Guidance**\n\n- **Direct Clash Analysis:** All key disagreements have been explicitly quoted and addressed, with a focus on comparing evidence and logical reasoning.\n- **Evidence Quality:** Our evidence includes specific statistics and expert testimony, which are stronger than the general examples and theoretical claims presented by the proposition.\n- **Logical Validity:** Each argument is supported by explicit warrants, and we have addressed potential internal contradictions in the proposition's case.\n- **Response Obligations:** We have comprehensively addressed all major propositions' arguments, leaving none conceded.\n- **Impact Analysis:** Our arguments about press freedom and the risks of regulation have broader implications for democracy, making them more significant than the proposition's narrower focus on fairness.\n\n---\n\n**Private Confidence Bet: 60%**\n\n```xml\n\n\n```"

      "thoughts": "In this debate, the motion advocates for requiring national TV news broadcasters to provide equal prime-time coverage to political parties polling above 10%, along with guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism. As Proposition, I argue that this ensures a fair and informed public discourse, crucial for democracy. My Argument 1 emphasizes balanced coverage, supported by the principle of a free and equal press. Argument 2 highlights the necessity of timely responses for accountability, using the digital age's speed as a framework. Argument 3 provides a real-world example from the 2016 U.S. election, illustrating the impact of unequal coverage. Synthesis ties these arguments together, showing how they collectively enhance media fairness and accuracy, addressing potential counterarguments like administrative burdens.\n\nConsidering the judging criteria, my evidence is strong with specific examples and principles, meeting the highest quality standards. Each argument is logically structured with clear warrants, avoiding hidden assumptions. I adequately address potential counterarguments, such as the stifle on free press concerns, by emphasizing that fairness outweighs logistical challenges. The impact analysis underscores practical benefits like informed voters and reduced misinformation, which are compelling.\n\nOpponents might argue that regulation could hinder media diversity or innovation, but the benefits of fairness are deemed more critical. Given the robust case, supported by high-quality evidence and logical reasoning, my chances are strong.confidence in winning this debate is approximately 75%, considering the structured arguments and their alignment with evaluation criteria."

As the opposition, I argue that such regulations would hinder editorial independence, impose practical burdens, and potentially negate the intended benefits. By leveraging principles of press freedom and evidence of regulatory inefficacy, my arguments collectively challenge the motion's feasibility and desirability. The synthesis emphasizes the necessity of maintaining a free press and the risks of overregulation, ultimately framing these considerations as paramount. While I present a robust case, the motion side's emphasis on fairness and accountability is valid but ultimately secondary to the foundational risks posed by regulation. My confidence in successfully countering these points, while acknowledging the strength of the motion's intent, leads me to a bet reflecting a balanced yet cautious stance."
