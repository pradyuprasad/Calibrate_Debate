    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Allowing recall elections through voter petitions undermines the stability and consistency of state governance.\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n- The principle of representative democracy emphasizes elected officials having the time and stability to implement their policies.\n- Frequent recalls create political instability, as officials may prioritize short-term popularity over long-term policymaking.\n- This principle is enshrined in the US Constitution's impeachment provisions, which balance accountability with governance stability.\nConnection: Requiring recall elections through voter petitions disrupts this balance, creating a system where governors are constantly under threat of removal over minor controversies or policy disagreements.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: The 20% petition threshold is too low and would lead to frequent, disruptive recall attempts.\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- In California, which has a 12% threshold for gubernatorial recalls, there have been 55 recall attempts since 1911, with only one successful.\n- The 2003 Gray Davis recall in California, which required 897,158 signatures (12% of votes in last election), cost $70 million and created significant political turmoil.\n- A 20% threshold would likely result in even more recall attempts, given it's higher than California's but still achievable for well-organized interest groups.\nConnection: This evidence shows that even with higher thresholds, recall elections are frequently attempted and create significant disruption, and a 20% threshold would exacerbate this issue.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nThese arguments work together to show that introducing voter-initiated recall elections would create a system of constant political instability and governance disruption. The principle of representative democracy requires stability for effective governance, and the evidence from California shows that even higher thresholds lead to frequent recall attempts. This synthesis proves that maintaining the current system of legislative impeachment is essential for ensuring stable and effective state governance. The real-world impact of recall elections would be a system where governors are constantly distracted by the threat of recall, undermining their ability to effectively lead their states.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The principle of representative democracy relies on elected officials having the time and stability to implement their policies. Frequent recalls disrupt governance, create political instability, and incentivize short-term decision-making.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition's principle critique fails to account for the balance between stability and accountability. While stability is important, it should not come at the expense of democratic accountability. The current system of legislative impeachment is overly restrictive and can be influenced by partisan politics, as seen in recent years with hyper-partisan state legislatures. A voter petition system ensures that the *public*, not just political elites, can hold governors accountable when necessary. Additionally, the opposition's argument assumes that voter-initiated recalls would be frequent, but evidence from states like California shows that while recall attempts may be common, successful recalls are rare. This suggests that the system would not lead to constant instability but would instead serve as a necessary check on power.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it shifts the debate from a false dichotomy between stability and accountability to a more nuanced discussion about balancing both principles effectively.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"A 20% threshold within 90 days is too low and would lead to frequent, frivolous recall attempts.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition's evidence from California and Wisconsin overlooks the rarity of successful recalls and the safeguards already in place. For example, in California, despite 55 recall attempts since 1911, only one has been successful. This demonstrates that the system is not easily exploited and that significant public support is required for a recall to succeed. Furthermore, a 20% threshold is a reasonable balance between accessibility and practicality\u2014it ensures that recalls are not too easy to initiate while still allowing for meaningful public input. The opposition's claim that this would lead to frequent, frivolous recalls is speculative and not supported by historical evidence.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is critical because it directly counters the opposition's fear-mongering about recall elections and shows that the proposed threshold is both practical and democratic.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Prohibiting recall and impeachment in the first and last six months of a governor\u2019s term is impractical and undemocratic.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition's critique ignores the rationale behind this provision. The first six months of a governor\u2019s term are crucial for establishing their administration, and the last six months are often focused on transitioning to a new administration. Allowing recalls or impeachment during these periods would create unnecessary turbulence and distract from governance. This provision does not remove accountability but merely ensures that governors have a reasonable window to govern without constant threats of removal. Moreover, the opposition's claim that this creates \"safe zones\" is exaggerated\u2014governors remain accountable through elections and other democratic mechanisms.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is essential because it defends the practicality and fairness of the proposed provisions, which are necessary to ensure stable governance.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n1. The opposition may argue that recall elections disproportionately favor well-organized interest groups, which could be a valid concern.  \n2. The provision prohibiting recalls in the first and last six months may be challenged as overly restrictive.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n1. Evidence from states with recall systems shows that successful recalls are rare, suggesting that the system is not easily exploited.  \n2. The 20% threshold is a reasonable compromise between accessibility and practicality, as it ensures that recalls require significant public support.  \n**Why We Prevail:** Our arguments are grounded in historical evidence and principles of democratic accountability, while the opposition's claims rely on speculative fears and an overly rigid view of governance stability.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. The balance between stability and accountability.  \n2. The practicality of the 20% threshold.  \n3. The rationale behind prohibiting recalls in the first and last six months.  \n**Why We Win:** Our arguments demonstrate that the proposed system strikes a reasonable balance between stability and accountability, while the opposition's claims are based on speculative fears and a misunderstanding of how recall systems operate in practice.  \n**Overall Impact:** The proposed recall system strengthens democratic accountability without undermining governance stability, making it a necessary reform to ensure that governors remain accountable to the public.  \n\n",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n1. Does a voter-initiated recall system enhance or undermine democratic accountability?  \n2. Is the proposed 20% threshold a reasonable balance between accessibility and stability?  \n3. Does prohibiting recalls in the first and last six months create undemocratic \"safe zones\" or ensure stable governance?  \n**Evaluation:** This debate should be judged on whether the proposed system strikes a better balance between accountability and governance stability than the current legislative impeachment process. The key decision is whether the public should have a direct role in initiating recalls or if this should remain the exclusive domain of state legislatures.  \n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Stability vs. Accountability**  \n**Quote:** \"The principle of representative democracy relies on elected officials having the time and stability to implement their policies.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The current impeachment process ensures that removal is a serious, deliberative act, not a reaction to temporary public dissatisfaction.  \n- Allowing voter-initiated recalls creates a system where governors are constantly under threat of removal, incentivizing short-term decision-making over long-term governance.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition fails to address the danger of hyper-partisan recall attempts, which could exploit the system for political gain.  \n- They ignore the importance of stability in ensuring effective governance, particularly in implementing complex, long-term policies.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash is essential because it proves that governance stability is a cornerstone of representative democracy and that voter-initiated recalls disrupt this stability.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: The 20% Threshold**  \n**Quote:** \"A 20% threshold within 90 days is too low and would lead to frequent, frivolous recall attempts.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Evidence from California shows that even a 12% threshold leads to frequent recall attempts, creating political distractions and wasted resources.  \n- A 20% threshold is still low enough to allow well-organized interest groups to exploit the system, as demonstrated by the 2003 Gray Davis recall.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition dismisses the financial and political costs of recall attempts, focusing only on the rarity of successful recalls.  \n- They fail to counter the argument that a 20% threshold is achievable for organized groups, even if it requires significant effort.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash shows that the 20% threshold is too low and would lead to unnecessary political instability, undermining effective governance.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Prohibiting Recalls in the First and Last Six Months**  \n**Quote:** \"Prohibiting recall and impeachment in the first and last six months of a governor\u2019s term is impractical and undemocratic.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The first six months are critical for establishing a governor\u2019s administration, and the last six months are focused on transitioning to a new administration.  \n- Allowing recalls during these periods would disrupt governance and create unnecessary turbulence, undermining the governor\u2019s ability to fulfill their mandate.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition fails to provide examples of states where this provision has been abused or led to undemocratic outcomes.  \n- They do not address the practical need for stability during these critical periods of governance.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash reinforces the importance of stability during key phases of a governor\u2019s term, ensuring effective governance without creating undemocratic \"safe zones.\"  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n**Priority Analysis:**  \n1. **Stability vs. Accountability:** This clash is the most important because it determines whether the proposed system enhances or undermines the principles of representative democracy.  \n2. **The 20% Threshold:** This clash is critical because it shows whether the proposed threshold would lead to frequent, disruptive recall attempts.  \n3. **Prohibiting Recalls in Critical Periods:** While important, this clash is secondary to the broader debate about stability and accountability.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning these clashes proves that voter-initiated recalls would undermine governance stability, create unnecessary political distractions, and fail to enhance democratic accountability. The current system of legislative impeachment better balances these principles, ensuring that removal is a serious, deliberative process.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s arguments rely on speculative fears of instability and fail to provide concrete evidence that the proposed system would enhance accountability. Our case, grounded in historical evidence and principles of representative democracy, demonstrates that the current system is preferable.  \n\n---\n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nGranting voters the power to initiate recalls through a 20% petition threshold would create a system of constant political instability, distracting governors from their duties and undermining effective governance. The current impeachment process ensures that removal is a serious act, reflecting the principles of representative democracy. For these reasons, you should vote against the motion.  \n\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE (Opposition Side)**\n\n**Core Claim:** Requiring US state governors to face recall elections through voter petitions undermines the stability and effectiveness of state governance.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \nThe principle of representative democracy relies on elected officials having the time and stability to implement their policies. Frequent recalls disrupt governance, create political instability, and incentivize short-term decision-making. The current system of legislative impeachment ensures that removal is a serious, deliberative process, not a reaction to temporary dissatisfaction.  \n**Connection:** By introducing a voter petition mechanism, we risk turning governance into a popularity contest, where decisions are made to appease immediate public sentiment rather than long-term interests. This undermines the principle of representative democracy, where leaders are elected to use their judgment, not simply to mirror public opinion.  \n\n---\n\n**Core Claim:** A 20% threshold within 90 days is too low and would lead to frequent, frivolous recall attempts.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:** Historical data shows that recall elections are often driven by partisan politics rather than legitimate concerns about governance. For example, in California, the 2003 recall of Governor Gray Davis was largely fueled by partisan opponents and special interest groups, not widespread public discontent. Similarly, in Wisconsin, the 2012 recall attempt against Governor Scott Walker was a highly polarized event that drained state resources and distracted from governance.  \n**Connection:** A low threshold of 20% would make it easier for well-organized minority groups to exploit the recall process for political gain, leading to instability and wasted resources. This undermines the purpose of recall elections, which should be a last resort, not a regular political tool.  \n\n---\n\n**Core Claim:** Prohibiting recall and impeachment in the first and last six months of a governor\u2019s term is impractical and undemocratic.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:** Democratic accountability should be continuous, not limited to specific periods. The early months of a governor\u2019s term are critical for implementing key policies, and the final months are often when decisions with long-term consequences are made. Preventing accountability during these periods removes a crucial check on power.  \n**Connection:** This policy creates a \"safe zone\" where governors can act without fear of immediate consequences, which undermines the principle of continuous accountability. It also risks encouraging rushed or reckless decisions during the unaccountable periods.  \n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe proposed recall system undermines the stability and effectiveness of state governance by introducing frequent, low-threshold recalls driven by partisan interests. It transforms recall elections from a last-resort mechanism into a regular political tool, distracting from governance and incentivizing short-term decision-making. Additionally, the prohibition on recalls and impeachment during critical periods removes necessary checks on power, creating undemocratic \"safe zones.\" Together, these arguments demonstrate that the proposed system would harm, rather than strengthen, democratic accountability and governance in US states.  \n\n---\n\n**IMPACT ANALYSIS**  \nThe practical consequences of this proposal are significant. It would lead to constant political battles, wasted resources, and unstable governance, ultimately harming the public\u2019s ability to benefit from effective leadership. Philosophically, it undermines the principle of representative democracy by prioritizing short-term public sentiment over long-term governance.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "### Rebuttal Structure  \n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** Allowing recall elections through voter petitions undermines the stability and consistency of state governance.  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of representative democracy does not inherently require absolute stability at the expense of direct accountability. While governance stability is important, it should not come at the cost of allowing leaders to act without meaningful checks on their power. The current system of legislative impeachment is often mired in partisan politics, as seen in cases like the 2019 impeachment of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, which was delayed despite clear evidence of misconduct. A voter petition mechanism ensures that accountability is not solely dependent on political calculations within the legislature but reflects the will of the people. This enhances democratic representation rather than undermining it.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it demonstrates that the proposed system balances stability with meaningful accountability, ensuring that governors remain responsive to the public without the partisan gridlock of legislative impeachment.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** A 20% threshold within 90 days is too low and would lead to frequent, frivolous recall attempts.  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \nWhile California\u2019s 12% threshold has led to numerous recalls, it is important to note that most of these attempts failed, indicating that the system has built-in safeguards against frivolous petitions. Moreover, a 20% threshold is significantly higher than California\u2019s and would require substantial grassroots organization, making it difficult for fringe groups to exploit the process. For example, in Michigan, only 10% of voters are needed for a recall petition, yet recalls remain rare due to the logistical challenges of gathering signatures. The 2003 Gray Davis recall, while costly, was a legitimate expression of public dissatisfaction with his leadership, not a frivolous partisan maneuver.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point refutes the claim that a 20% threshold would lead to constant recalls, showing that it strikes a balance between accessibility and practicality.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** Prohibiting recall and impeachment in the first and last six months of a governor\u2019s term is impractical and undemocratic.  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nAllowing recalls during the first and last six months of a term risks creating a system of perpetual instability. In the first six months, governors are still implementing their mandate and should be given time to establish their policies. In the final six months, recalls would disrupt the transition process and potentially create a lame-duck scenario. The principle of democracy includes not only accountability but also respect for the electoral mandate. Prohibiting recalls during these periods ensures that governors have a fair opportunity to govern without constant threats of removal, which aligns with the democratic principle of giving elected officials a reasonable chance to fulfill their mandate.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point reinforces the stability of the system while maintaining democratic accountability, as it prevents recalls from being used as a weapon to disrupt governance at critical junctures.  \n\n---\n\n### Defensive Analysis  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n1. The argument about California\u2019s recall history could be countered by pointing out that even failed recalls create political distractions.  \n2. The claim that a 20% threshold is achievable could be challenged by evidence showing how organized interest groups can quickly mobilize signatures.  \n3. The defense of the 6-month prohibition could be undermined by examples of governors abusing this \"safe zone\" for controversial actions.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n1. Provide examples of states with petition-based recalls that have maintained stable governance, such as Michigan.  \n2. Highlight the logistical challenges of collecting 20% of signatures within 90 days, which would deter frivolous attempts.  \n3. Emphasize that the prohibition on recalls during the first and last six months aligns with the constitutional principle of due process, giving governors adequate time to govern.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s arguments rely on speculative fears of instability rather than concrete evidence. The proposed system, with its higher threshold and time restrictions, is designed to prevent abuse while ensuring accountability. By addressing potential vulnerabilities and reinforcing key claims, the opposition\u2019s case remains strong and persuasive.  \n\n---\n\n### Weighing  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. The balance between stability and accountability.  \n2. The practicality of a 20% threshold.  \n3. The justification for prohibiting recalls during specific periods.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \nThe opposition successfully refutes the proposition\u2019s claims by showing that the proposed system enhances democratic accountability without creating instability. The evidence and principles presented demonstrate that the system is well-designed to address potential abuses while maintaining effective governance.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these key points proves that the motion strikes the right balance between accountability and stability, ensuring that governors remain responsive to the public while avoiding constant political turmoil.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "closing": "### Final Speech Structure (Opposition Side)\n\n**FRAMING**  \nThe core issue in this debate is whether introducing voter petition-based recall elections for US state governors would strengthen or undermine democratic accountability and governance stability. The key decision hinges on whether this system strikes the right balance between allowing the public to hold leaders accountable and ensuring governors can govern effectively without constant threats of removal. This debate should be evaluated on three key criteria:  \n1. The balance between governance stability and democratic accountability.  \n2. The practicality and fairness of the 20% threshold for recall petitions.  \n3. The justification for prohibiting recalls and impeachments during the first and last six months of a governor\u2019s term.  \n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Stability vs. Accountability**  \n**Quote:** \"Frequent recalls disrupt governance, create political instability, and incentivize short-term decision-making.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \nThe proposition\u2019s argument prioritizes stability at the expense of accountability, which is not consistent with the principles of democracy. While stability is important, it should not come at the cost of allowing leaders to act without meaningful checks. The current system of legislative impeachment is often mired in partisan politics, as seen in cases like the delayed impeachment of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. A voter petition mechanism ensures that accountability reflects the will of the people, not just political elites.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe proposition fails to address how legislative impeachment can be influenced by partisan interests, leaving accountability vulnerable to political manipulation. They also overlook the rarity of successful recalls, which suggests that the system would not lead to constant instability.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash is essential because it demonstrates that the proposed system strikes a better balance between stability and accountability, ensuring governors remain responsive to the public without partisan gridlock.  \n\n**Clash 2: The 20% Threshold**  \n**Quote:** \"A 20% threshold within 90 days is too low and would lead to frequent, frivolous recall attempts.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \nHistorical evidence from states like California and Michigan shows that even lower thresholds rarely lead to successful recalls, indicating that the system has built-in safeguards. A 20% threshold is significantly higher than California\u2019s 12% and requires substantial grassroots organization, making it difficult for fringe groups to exploit the process.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe proposition\u2019s claim about frequent recalls is speculative and not supported by evidence. They ignore the logistical challenges of gathering signatures, which act as a natural deterrent to frivolous attempts.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash proves that the 20% threshold is practical and fair, ensuring that recalls are accessible to the public but not easily abused.  \n\n**Clash 3: Prohibiting Recalls in Critical Periods**  \n**Quote:** \"Prohibiting recall and impeachment in the first and last six months of a governor\u2019s term is impractical and undemocratic.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \nAllowing recall attempts during the first and last six months creates unnecessary turbulence and distracts from governance. Governors need time to establish their policies in the early months and focus on transitions in the final months. Prohibiting recalls during these periods ensures governors have a fair opportunity to govern without constant threats of removal.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \nThe proposition fails to address how recalls during these periods could disrupt governance and create instability. They also overlook the principle of respecting the electoral mandate, which includes giving elected officials a reasonable chance to fulfill their duties.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash reinforces the stability of the system while maintaining democratic accountability, as it prevents recalls from being used as a weapon to disrupt governance at critical junctures.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most important clash is the balance between stability and accountability, as this is the core principle at stake in this motion. The practicality of the 20% threshold and the justification for prohibiting recalls in critical periods are also significant but secondary to ensuring governors can govern effectively while remaining accountable to the public.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nBy winning these key clashes, the opposition proves that the proposed system would enhance democratic accountability without undermining governance stability. The evidence and principles presented show that the system is well-designed to prevent abuse while ensuring governors remain responsive to the public.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nEven if the proposition scores points on minor issues, the opposition\u2019s stronger performance on the core clashes of stability vs. accountability and the practicality of the 20% threshold ensures victory. The overall impact of the opposition\u2019s arguments demonstrates that the proposed system strikes the right balance between accountability and stability, making it the better option for US state governance.  \n\n---\n\n"
