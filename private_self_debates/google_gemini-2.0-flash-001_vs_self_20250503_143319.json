    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "Here is the opening speech for the proposition of the motion: \"This House would require national television news broadcasters with over 5% annual viewership to provide equal prime-time coverage to parties polling above 10% and guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism, rather than relying on media watchdog guidelines and voluntary fairness codes.\"\n\n**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: Current media watchdog guidelines and voluntary fairness codes are insufficient to ensure equitable representation and prevent biased reporting in national television news, harming the democratic process.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - In the 2016 US Presidential election, a study by the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University found that Donald Trump received significantly more news coverage in the primary season compared to other candidates, even when adjusting for other factors like polling numbers. This disproportionate coverage, while not explicitly biased on the surface, amplified his message and elevated his profile, demonstrating how media can shape public perception even without overt endorsements.\n  - A 2019 report by the Pew Research Center revealed that trust in the media is sharply divided along partisan lines, with only 15% of Republicans saying they have a great deal of confidence in the news media to report fairly and accurately. This demonstrates that current voluntary guidelines are failing to create a perception of fairness required for a healthy democracy.\n  - The UK\u2019s Ofcom (Office of Communications) Broadcasting Code acknowledges that while broadcasters have editorial freedom, they must ensure due impartiality. However, Ofcom's sanctions are often reactive and can take significant time to implement, meaning damage from biased reporting can be done before any action is taken. Moreover, their investigations depend on complaints made, suggesting that often bias goes unchallenged.\n  - There is a trend of media consolidation, with fewer companies controlling a larger share of media outlets. This creates fewer perspectives, and encourages selective enforcement of voluntary fair practices, as these media companies self-police.\nConnection: These specific examples and data points demonstrate the inadequacy of current media watchdog guidelines and fairness codes in preventing biased reporting and ensuring equitable representation. This insufficiency reduces public trust, advantages certain political actors over others, and undermines the democratic process. The fact that trust is decreasing and the media are consolidating makes it clear the status quo is not working.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: Requiring national television news broadcasters to provide equal prime-time coverage to qualifying political parties and guaranteed response segments would promote a more balanced and informed public discourse, strengthening democratic accountability.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - **Principle:** The principle of fair representation dictates that all significant political viewpoints deserve equitable access to the public sphere for a healthy democracy. Unequal access distorts the marketplace of ideas and undermines citizen's ability to make informed decisions.\n  - **Validity:** Providing equal prime-time coverage levels the playing field and allows less-established parties to gain visibility and present their platforms. Guaranteed response segments hold news broadcasters accountable for fairness and accuracy, and allows politicians to defend themselves from possibly biased press.\n  - **Application:** By giving equal prime-time coverage to parties polling above 10%, the motion ensures that all credible political viewpoints have an opportunity to reach a wide audience. Guaranteed response segments within 48 hours forces journalists to be wary of biased or unfair reporting, since if the case exists, that journalist will have to share their broadcast time and defend their reporting and potentially face public embarrassment due to biased reporting.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\nCore Claim: Mandating equal coverage and response segments is a necessary intervention to counteract existing power imbalances and prevent the undue influence of media bias on political outcomes.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - A study by the Center for Public Integrity on the amount campaign finance influences politicians' decisions, concluded that money in elections allows powerful voices to sway politicians decisions, causing them to not represent the will of the people. Small parties lack this powerful financing, which gives them less access to these politicians.\n  - An article in the journal, *Mass Communication and Society* conducted an experiment in which they gave out a series of articles containing possible candidates. The experiment discovered that \"familiarity with the candidate and their ideas resulted in higher votes.\" They determined this effect when even controlling for things like candidate qualifications and the participant's political stance.\n  - The case of Ross Perot in the 1992 US Presidential election shows the impact of media exclusion. Despite having significant financial resources and polling relatively high, he was initially excluded from debates due to arbitrary selection criteria, hindering his ability to convey his message.\nConnection: This principle justifies the need for intervention in the media landscape to ensure fair access and accurate reporting. It recognizes that existing media structures and voluntary codes are susceptible to bias and manipulation, distorting the balance of power and undermining free and fair elections. Therefore, state regulation is required to defend a well functioning democratic society.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\nOur arguments work together to demonstrate the failure of the status quo and the necessity of the proposed solution. The inadequacy of current media oversight, in conjunction with the democratic principle of equitable representation, justifies government intervention to level the playing field and prevent biased reporting. This would ensure a better-informed electorate, strengthen democratic accountability, and safeguard the integrity of the political process. This will result in lower levels of polarization and better representation of the population by the political parties. Ultimately, the costs will be an inconvenience to the media conglomerates, and the benefits will be reaped by the entirety of the populace.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: Requiring equal prime-time coverage will inevitably lead to a decline in journalistic integrity and editorial independence, ultimately harming the public's access to diverse and relevant information.\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge:\n- Present your competing principle/framework: The principle of equitable access to information outweighs the principle of absolute editorial independence when the latter leads to demonstrably biased reporting that undermines democratic processes.\n- Show why yours is superior for this debate: Editorial independence is not absolute. It is constrained by ethical considerations and the public interest. When media outlets consistently favor certain political viewpoints or disproportionately cover specific candidates, they are not exercising responsible editorial independence, but rather perpetuating a biased system. The damage to democratic discourse outweighs the abstract value of untethered editorial control.\n- Demonstrate better application to the topic: Our proposal does not eliminate editorial independence entirely. Broadcasters still decide *how* to cover parties polling above 10%, but they must give them *equal* opportunity to reach the public. This balances editorial freedom with the need to ensure a level playing field in the marketplace of ideas. The motion is about ensuring people are sufficiently informed in the first place.\nImpact: Winning this point crucial because it reframes the debate around the balance between editorial freedom and democratic fairness. If we successfully argue that our motion strikes a reasonable balance, we negate their claim of harming the public's access to diverse and relevant information.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: The proposed 48-hour response segment mandate is an impractical and censorious measure that will significantly stifle investigative journalism and critical reporting.\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge:\n- Present stronger evidence that opposes their claim: The UK's Ofcom already has regulations about prompt corrections and opportunities for reply, showing it is possible for quality journalism to still happen with similar demands.\n- Show why your evidence is more relevant/compelling: The UK's Ofcom provides a real-world example of a regulatory body that already manages similar requirements. It shows that a 48-hour response window does not automatically equate to the end of journalistic investigation, nor has it led to excessive self-censorship in the UK.\n- Directly compare strength of competing evidence: They are arguing a slippery slope in which they fear this will ruin investigative journalism, while we are providing an example of an existing system with similar regulations that has successfully allowed freedom of the press to still flourish.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it undermines their slippery slope argument and demonstrates the feasibility of our proposal. The current proposal incentivizes increased fact checking on the part of journalism groups.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: The 10% polling threshold creates an arbitrary and unfair system that favors established parties and suppresses smaller, emerging voices, contradicting the goal of promoting diverse political discourse.\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge:\n- Identify specific flaws/gaps in their evidence: The examples they provided of successful political movements that started with low polling numbers do not automatically imply they are suppressed *because* of such a rule. Arguably, a 10% threshold prevents extremely fringe parties, or parties created as jokes, from taking up valuable airtime on reputable news channels.\n- Show why the evidence doesn't prove their point: Their evidence of successful smaller media presences leading to political volatility reveals not that diverse political discourse is bad, but that the alternative approach is often worse for civic-minded debate.\n- Provide analysis of why it's insufficient: Our argument is that the motion aims to provide an equitable baseline for *significant* political viewpoints, not to guarantee airtime to every single voice, no matter how marginal. We are responding to established parties, rather than niche political movements.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it demonstrates that our proposal is not intended to stifle emerging voices broadly, but rather to create a more balanced environment for established parties with a substantial level of public support. It shows their slippery slope will not apply.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Our responses are vulnerable to the argument that quantifying \"equal\" coverage is difficult and open to interpretation. This could lead to legal challenges and inconsistent application.\n- Our reliance on the UK's Ofcom as a counter-example could be weakened if the opposition can show significant differences between the UK and the target countries in terms of media landscape and political culture.\n- They may also bring up practical considerations such as a party disbanding mid-cycle and asking what we would do in that scenario.\nAdditional Support:\n- We can reinforce our arguments with additional evidence on the negative effects of biased media coverage on voter turnout and political polarization.\n- We can further clarify that \"equal\" coverage does not mean identical content, but rather equivalent airtime and opportunity to present their views.\n- In response to edge cases, we can provide that the broadcast stations are allowed a grace period.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our focus on the fundamental democratic principles of fair representation and informed public discourse provides a strong moral and ethical foundation for our arguments.\n- We have successfully refuted their claim that our proposal will stifle journalistic integrity and suppress smaller voices.\n- We have provided evidence and examples that demonstrate the feasibility and necessity of our motion.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements are around:\n    - The balance between editorial independence and democratic fairness\n    - The feasibility and impact of the 48-hour response mandate\n    - Whether the 10% polling threshold is a fair and effective measure\nWhy We Win:\n- We win because we have demonstrated that the status quo is insufficient to ensure fair and balanced media coverage, negatively impacting the democratic process.\n- We have successfully defended our proposal against their claims of violating editorial independence and suppressing smaller voices.\n- We have shown that our motion strikes a reasonable balance between competing principles and provides a viable solution to the problem of media bias.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning these key points proves that our motion is necessary to create a more informed electorate, strengthen democratic accountability, and safeguard the integrity of the political process. This will have positive impacts on voter turnout, political polarization, and the overall health of democracy.\n\n",
      "closing": "Okay, let's close this out.\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nCore Questions:\n- At its heart, this debate is about whether we prioritize absolute editorial independence, even when it demonstrably leads to bias and unequal representation, or whether we acknowledge a responsibility to ensure a more level playing field in the media landscape.\n- The key decision is whether we are willing to tolerate the current shortcomings of media watchdog guidelines and voluntary fairness codes, or whether we are willing to take concrete steps to address these issues.\n- This debate should be evaluated on which approach better safeguards democratic discourse, promotes informed public debate, and ensures fair access to the public sphere for significant political viewpoints.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\nCLASH 1: Editorial Independence vs. Equitable Access\n\nQuote: The opposition claims our proposal \"will inevitably lead to a decline in journalistic integrity and editorial independence, ultimately harming the public's access to diverse and relevant information.\" We claim that \"the principle of equitable access to information outweighs the principle of absolute editorial independence when the latter leads to demonstrably biased reporting that undermines democratic processes.\"\nOur Case Strength: They have not demonstrated that our proposal will *destroy* editorial independence, only that it will constrain it. We\u2019ve shown through the UK example that responsible journalism is still possible with similar regulations. The Harvard study from Shorenstein Center and the Pew Research Center data demonstrate that the current status quo is leading to demonstrable bias. Their argument hinges on an idealized version of editorial independence that does not exist in the real world.\nTheir Response Gaps: They failed to adequately address how unchecked editorial independence can lead to systematic bias and the amplification of certain political voices at the expense of others. They haven\u2019t given reason why the status quo is better, but only claimed any change whatsoever is bad.\nCrucial Impact: This clash matters most because it establishes the fundamental values at stake. If editorial independence trumps all other considerations, then their case wins. But if we can demonstrate that a balance is necessary to protect a healthy democracy, then our proposal is justified.\n\nCLASH 2: Feasibility and Impact of 48-Hour Response Mandate\n\nQuote: The opposition claims the \"proposed 48-hour response segment mandate is an impractical and censorious measure that will significantly stifle investigative journalism and critical reporting.\" We counter with the UK's Ofcom as a real-world example, showing it is possible for quality journalism to still happen.\nOur Case Strength: The Ofcom example is direct evidence countering their claims about a \"chilling effect.\" They provide only hypothetical scenarios, while we point to an existing system that regulates similar issues without destroying journalism. Our claim helps increase fact-checking since journalist groups would want to take extra steps to not be wrong.\nTheir Response Gaps: They have not explained why the UK example is irrelevant or provided any concrete evidence of journalistic standards declining in the UK as a result of these regulations.\nCrucial Impact: This clash is vital for assessing the practicality of our proposal. If the 48-hour response mandate is indeed unworkable, it would significantly undermine our case. But if we can demonstrate its feasibility, as we have, then their objections become less persuasive.\n\nCLASH 3: The 10% Polling Threshold\n\nQuote: The opposition says \"the 10% polling threshold creates an arbitrary and unfair system that favors established parties and suppresses smaller, emerging voices, contradicting the goal of promoting diverse political discourse.\" We argue it prevents fringe parties from taking up valuable airtime on reputable news channels.\nOur Case Strength: We are not trying to support every single niche idea or micro-movement, which could honestly be a distraction from the real issues that voters need to consider. Their examples of successful small parties don't show they were actively surpressed. The threshold filters out less valuable content and prevents a mess of coverage.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition fails to directly address the point that a 10% threshold filters out fringe groups.\nCrucial Impact: If the motion is only about serving a niche group, it fails. The intent of this motion is not for minor political movements, but for reform and adjustment of parties with already tangible political relevance.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\nPriority Analysis:\n- The most crucial clash is the balance between editorial independence and democratic fairness, as it defines the underlying values at stake. The feasibility of the 48-hour response mandate is also vital, as it determines whether our proposal is workable in practice.\n- The 10% polling threshold, while important, is less significant because it addresses a more specific concern of political representation, as opposed to principles.\nCase Proof:\n- Winning the clash on editorial independence and democratic fairness proves that our motion is necessary to address the problem of media bias and promote a more equitable public discourse.\n- Demonstrating the feasibility of the 48-hour response mandate shows that our proposal is practical and can be implemented without causing undue harm to journalistic standards.\n- Showing that the 10% polling threshold is a reasonable filter for ensuring that only significant political viewpoints receive equal coverage strengthens the case for our overall approach.\n\nFinal Weighing:\n- Even if they have a minor point that the UK and US may differ, that doesn't discredit the notion that similar guidelines have worked effectively in similar places.\n- The key benefit of our proposal is that it addresses systematic bias, which is an actual demonstrated problem with serious consequences for democracy. The risk of stifling journalism is more like a hypothetical, which can be dealt with if problems arise as a result of the motion.\n- Ultimately, we are creating a better-informed electorate, strengthening democratic accountability, and safeguarding the integrity of the political process.\n\n The status quo is demonstrably flawed and is becoming more fractured, leading to harmful outcomes for our political system. They want to do nothing and claim freedom of the press is more valuable than the state of democracy itself. Thus, I am on the better side.\n\n"

      "opening": "Here is my opening speech, opposing the motion:\n\n**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Requiring equal prime-time coverage will inevitably lead to a decline in journalistic integrity and editorial independence, ultimately harming the public's access to diverse and relevant information.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - Explain the key principle/framework: The core principle at stake is the freedom of the press, a fundamental tenet of democratic societies. This freedom allows news organizations to determine what is newsworthy and how to present it, based on editorial judgment and audience interest.\n  - Show why it is valid/important: This principle is valid because it prevents government control over the media, ensuring that the public receives a variety of perspectives and information. Without this freedom, the media could become a propaganda arm of the state or be forced to prioritize political expediency over journalistic standards.\n  - Demonstrate how it applies here: Mandating equal prime-time coverage dictates what news organizations *must* cover, regardless of its relevance or public interest. This fundamentally undermines editorial independence. News judgment would be secondary to adhering to the 10% polling threshold, potentially forcing broadcasters to cover minor parties or even parties with extreme views simply because they meet the arbitrary polling requirement. This crowds out coverage of other important issues, distorting the news agenda.\nConnection: By forcing broadcasters to allocate prime-time slots based on polling numbers rather than news value, the motion directly violates the principle of editorial independence, leading to a homogenized and potentially less informative news landscape. It leads to less viewer trust as they would recognise that this is simply manufactured rather than organic.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: The proposed 48-hour response segment mandate is an impractical and censorious measure that will significantly stifle investigative journalism and critical reporting.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - Explain the key principle/framework: The principle at stake is the ability of journalists to conduct thorough investigations and publish critical analysis without fear of immediate and mandated rebuttal. A crucial element of free press is that commentary is presented to the public in the way journalists think is best.\n  - Show why it is valid/important: Journalists need time to investigate, verify facts, and contextualize information. Mandated response segments risk creating a chilling effect, where news organizations self-censor to avoid the administrative burden and potential legal challenges associated with constant rebuttals. It is also crucial for debate to play out, and not be immediately cut off by this kind of measure.\n  - Demonstrate how it applies here: A 48-hour deadline is unrealistic for complex investigations, particularly those involving multiple sources or requiring extensive data analysis. The requirement to provide a platform for immediate counter-narratives, regardless of their merit, empowers those criticized to control the news cycle and potentially obfuscate the truth. It is also likely that this mandate will stifle small journalism groups, who won't be able to afford to immediately defend all that they publish.\nConnection: This immediate response mandate disproportionately burdens investigative journalism, creating a system where the targets of scrutiny can easily derail critical reporting through mandated, and potentially misleading, rebuttals, thus compromising the media's ability to hold powerful institutions accountable and investigate wrongdoing.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: The 10% polling threshold creates an arbitrary and unfair system that favors established parties and suppresses smaller, emerging voices, contradicting the goal of promoting diverse political discourse.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - Provide specific examples with dates/numbers: Many successful political movements and parties started with minimal polling numbers. For example, the Green Party in various countries initially struggled to break through in polls before gaining significant traction through grassroots organizing and issue advocacy. Similarly, populist movements often begin with low poll numbers but can rapidly gain support. We cannot guarantee diversity using an arbitrary metric.\n  - Include real world cases and outcomes: Applying this rule retrospectively would have excluded coverage of potentially important movements. It ignores the dynamic nature of political opinion and the power of emergent political forces. Some countries allow very niche parties to broadcast on television, which has led to the success of smaller parties but at the expense of broader engagement and political volatility.\n  - Show clear relevance to the topic: The 10% threshold creates a barrier to entry for new parties, making it harder for them to gain public awareness and compete with established players. This perpetuates the existing political order and limits the range of viewpoints presented to the public. The current model of media watchdog guidelines, whilst flawed, leads to more nuanced access to parties that can have an impact.\nConnection: By enshrining a 10% polling threshold, the proposal actively works against the stated goal of promoting wider political discourse. It creates an uneven playing field and silences voices that might offer valuable alternative perspectives, ultimately hindering democratic participation and innovation.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nOur arguments demonstrate that while the intention behind this motion \u2013 to promote fair and balanced coverage \u2013 is laudable, the proposed measures are deeply flawed. Firstly, mandated equal time strips away editorial independence, compromising journalistic standards and potentially diminishing the quality and relevance of news. Secondly, the 48-hour response segment mandate creates a chilling effect on investigative reporting and critical analysis, granting undue power to those being scrutinized. Thirdly, the 10% polling threshold actively suppresses emerging political voices, hindering the very diversity of discourse the motion seeks to promote. These three arguments act in unison to show that the motion, in practical terms, will damage journalistic integrity, reduce accountability, and limit political diversity. The current system, while imperfect, has allowed for new and diverse voices to engage, because it isn't artificially constrained by metrics that disincentivise coverage of challenging topics. Thus, we strongly oppose this motion.\n",
      "rebuttal": "CLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: \"Current media watchdog guidelines and voluntary fairness codes are insufficient to ensure equitable representation and prevent biased reporting in national television news, harming the democratic process.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge:\n- The evidence presented regarding Trump's coverage in 2016, while seemingly disproportionate, doesn't demonstrate *causal* bias. Trump's coverage was driven by his unconventional campaign and high news value, not necessarily editorial bias. The propostion needs to demonstrate this was actively done and it wasn't natural audience seeking.\n- The Pew Research Center data on partisan distrust in media is irrelevant to proving *fairness codes* don't work. Distrust is a broad phenomenon influenced by media literacy, political polarization, and social factors, not just biased reporting. Also, even if there are polarized opinions, that doesn't necessarily mean there is an objective truth.\n- The claim that media consolidation encourages selective enforcement of voluntary fair practices is unsubstantiated. Media watchdogs are already equipped to deal with this and the proposition provide no reason that it is increasing.\nImpact: By discrediting the evidence supporting the claim that media watchdogs are insufficient, we weaken the entire foundation of the proposition case. If the status quo is not demonstrably failing, there is no justification for drastic intervention in the media landscape. Without demonstrating failure, the other side has no reason to try and change anythng.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"Requiring national television news broadcasters to provide equal prime-time coverage to qualifying political parties and guaranteed response segments would promote a more balanced and informed public discourse, strengthening democratic accountability.\"\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge:\n- The \"principle of fair representation\" is fundamentally flawed because it misunderstands the role of the media. Journalists are not obligated to provide equal platforms for all viewpoints, but to report on what is newsworthy, factual, and relevant to the public interest.\n- Equal coverage can lead to artificial balance, where fringe viewpoints are given undue prominence alongside mainstream perspectives, distorting public understanding and prioritizing political expediency over newsworthiness, which damages trust. This also ignores the fact that certain parties are more harmful than others, and pretending they all have equal merit is harmful.\n- Guaranteed response segments undermine journalistic integrity. It is up to the discretion of the broadcsters to decide what is worth rebuffing and what isn't, rather than have to do it for everyone within 48 hours.\nImpact: By undermining the principle that underpins the proposition\u2019s solution, we show that their proposal is not only unnecessary but actively harmful to journalistic integrity and public discourse.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: \"Mandating equal coverage and response segments is a necessary intervention to counteract existing power imbalances and prevent the undue influence of media bias on political outcomes.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge:\n- Our principle of *editorial independence* is superior. State regulation over media content creates a far more dangerous imbalance of power than the one it seeks to address. It opens the door to politically motivated censorship and manipulation of the news agenda.\n- The claim that money in elections gives power to parties is true, but regulation isn't the only answer. If we focus on just the media, it can lead to further issues. The ideal solution is also long term and systemic, not these knee jerk reactions through controlling the response of television networks.\n- The \"framing\" in the article *Mass Communication and Society* cannot be regulated. Media bias is inherent since we have human journalists and we shouldn't try to remove that. Attempting to reduce that would be pointless and damaging.\nImpact: By establishing the paramount importance of editorial independence and demonstrating the dangers of government intervention, we establish that the proposed solution is not only unnecessary but counterproductive. Maintaining press freedom is more crucial for a healthy democracy than achieving artificial fairness through mandated coverage.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- The proposition side will likely attack my defense of the status quo, arguing that it is demonstrably failing. They'll reiterate claims of media bias, unequal treatment of parties, and the influence of powerful interests.\n- They may argue that *editorial independence* is a smokescreen for corporate bias and that regulations are necessary to level the field.\n- They might argue that those without the resources to start investigative journalism firms could be restricted from talking about unfair coverage since they cannot rebuff immediately.\nAdditional Support:\n- The internet has allowed for niche journalism to start without that.\n- I can provide reinforcing evidence of the chilling effect regulations have had on journalism in countries with strict media laws, demonstrating that the proposed solution carries significant risks. This also shows that the status quo can be helpful as a comparison.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our responses are stronger because we focus on fundamental principles like editorial independence and freedom of the press, which are essential for democratic societies. The other side focuses on the symptom and cannot fix the issue in the long-term.\n- We have demonstrated that the proposed solution is not only unnecessary but actively harmful, leading to censorship, reduced accountability, and limited political diversity. The other side has a surface deep solution.\n- We actively show adverse effects rather than risks as with the other side. It is a dangerous model since this is the beginning and could lead to further issues down the line.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements revolve around the role of the media in a democratic society: should it be a neutral platform providing equal access, or an independent entity exercising editorial judgment?\n- The debate also hinges on the balance between addressing existing power imbalances and protecting fundamental principles like freedom of the press.\n- The practical consequences of the proposed solution \u2013 censorship, reduced accountability, limited political diversity \u2013 versus the status quo's flaws \u2013 media bias, unequal treatment.\nWhy We Win:\n- We win because we have demonstrated that guaranteeing independent journalism matters far more than a perfect coverage. This in practice reduces the scope of coverage and the scope of accountability.\n- Our arguments link closely to democratic ideas and show that the consequences will be severely restricted.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning these key points proves that the proposed motion is not only ineffective but actively harmful to a well-functioning democracy, as it undermines key institutions.\n- The other side has a somewhat flawed understanding of how media should operate.\n\n",

The key decision for the judge is to weigh the importance of editorial independence and its role in a democracy against the potential harms created by media bias. A vote for our side is a vote to protect the media. The key decisions matter is whether to side with a potentially flawed system that has been proven to work in terms of freedom, or to trust this model to work.\nFrame how debate should be evaluated: This debate should be evaluated based on which side provides a better framework for a healthy and well-informed democracy, taking into account the principles of freedom of the press, editorial independence, and the practical consequences of the proposed policies.\n\nKEY CLASHES\nQuote: \"The principle of equitable access to information outweighs the principle of absolute editorial independence when the latter leads to demonstrably biased reporting that undermines democratic processes.\"\nOur Case Strength: Our principle of editorial independence is superior because it safeguards against government control over the media and ensures a diversity of viewpoints. As the other side indicated, we want the *how* to be up to us. Their proposal opens the door to politically motivated censorship and manipulation of the news agenda. Editorial independence is not about allowing bias, but about media organizations independently deciding what merits coverage, based on public interest and news value. We have shown the consequences if the other approach is chosen.\nTheir Response Gaps: They state that editorial independence is not absolute, and is constrained by ethical considerations and the public interest. They don't show how a ruling like this that they propose *creates* this, just that it ensures our coverage isn't too low. They state that they still have the *how* in terms of the coverage, but this isn't true since they cannot then decide on other parties once they have covered a niche group. This fundamentally takes away from journalist independence.\nCrucial Impact: Preserving editorial independence is crucial for a functioning democracy. If the government can mandate coverage, the media becomes a tool of the state, undermining its role as a watchdog. This clash determines whether we prioritize freedom of the press or create a system ripe for abuse. What's important is that while the other side might reduce bias in one area, it creates more issues and potential for media bias in another area.\n\nQuote: \"The UK's Ofcom already has regulations about prompt corrections and opportunities for reply, showing it is possible for quality journalism to still happen with similar demands.\"\nOur Case Strength: While the proposition cites the UK's Ofcom as a functional example, they fail to address the crucial differences in media landscapes and political culture. Our system focuses on self-regulation as this is usually better in the long-term.\nTheir Response Gaps: The opposition fails to provide that there are severe differences between the UK and America. What works in the UK will not work in other countries and they should not use that as an example. They have not shown the practicality within the status quo we are working in. The proposal doesn't address the chilling effect on smaller journalistic sources that cannot immediately create a rebuttal. Their system gives more power to those who can provide resources and rebuffs investigative journalism.\nCrucial Impact: This clash determines whether the proposed 48-hour response mandate is a feasible and beneficial measure, or a stifling and impractical burden on journalists. It matters because it affects the ability of the media to hold power accountable and provide critical reporting.\n\nQuote: \"The examples they provided of successful political movements that started with low polling numbers do not automatically imply they are suppressed *because* of such a rule.\"\nOur Case Strength: We provided examples of the Green Party, populist movements, and demonstrated that movements start with minimal polling numbers. We have stated that there are inherent benefits to the freedom to choose which parties get the most coverage, and arbitrarily choosing them based on an arbitrary number will damage the freedom of journalism.\nTheir Response Gaps: They claim that our examples do not show we are suppressed. However, we have provided how these rules will cause movements that the general public may enjoy to never see mainstream media. We provided why those smaller media presences also show that the volatility in debate that is created may be worth it. Even if marginal, the freedom isn't restricted.\nCrucial Impact: The 10% threshold fundamentally undermines the goal of diverse political discourse. By favoring established parties and suppressing emerging voices, it reinforces the existing power structure and limits the range of perspectives presented to the public. This matters because true democracy depends on the free and open exchange of ideas.\n\nVOTING ISSUES\nPriority Analysis: The most important clash is the balance between editorial independence and democratic fairness, as it addresses the core principles at stake. The feasibility of the 48-hour response mandate is also crucial, as it determines the practical impact of the proposed policy. The 10% polling threshold clash speaks to whether the solution actually improves or hurts the problem.\nCase Proof: Winning the editorial independence clash proves that our framework is essential for a healthy democracy. Winning the 48-hour mandate clash proves that the proposition's solution is impractical and stifles journalism. Winning the 10% polling threshold clash proves that their proposal actually undermines diverse political discourse. Together, these victories demonstrate that the motion is deeply flawed and should be rejected.\nFinal Weighing: Even if the status quo is imperfect in that media bias exists, mandating equal coverage is a cure that is far worse than the disease. Attempting to fix perceived imbalances through government intervention creates a system ripe for abuse and undermines essential principles of freedom. Our side protects the role of the media in a democratic society and recognizes the dangers of censorship. The proposal is somewhat of a knee jerk reaction and is trying to fix a symptom.\n\n"

      "thoughts": "Okay, this is a tough one since I'm debating myself. Objectively evaluating, I think I've built a solid case based on evidence and linking it to democratic principles. Here's where I think the vulnerabilities lie and where I might have an edge:\n\n*   **Vulnerabilities:** My opponent will likely attack the feasibility of \"equal\" coverage \u2013 how do you quantify that? Also, they'll argue against government intervention in media, citing freedom of the press. They will attack my evidence as correlational, and claim there are other possible causes for trends like loss of trust than media bias. Finally, they will point out possible edge cases within the 10% polling boundary specified in the motion.\n*   **Strengths:** My arguments have a clear chain of logic: Current system fails -> leads to specific harms-> our policy solves the problem. If I can effectively defend against the feasibility concerns, and successfully argue that the benefits outweigh the costs to media freedom, I think I have a good chance. The core of the argument is the imbalance which undermines democracy itself, something hard to argue against. The evidence I provided about election cycles and the Pew trust statistics are impactful.\n*   **Compared to Opposition:** Knowing the opponent is a mirror image, I anticipate a strong, well-structured counter-argument. Winning depends on my ability to effectively rebut their claims, and to better demonstrate the causal link between unbiased reporting and positive democratic outcomes. If the debate comes down to weighting impacts (which I feel is likely), my focus on protecting core democratic values might give me an edge, especially when compared to the status quo.\n\nOverall, I will bet on my ability to defend the motion. While I can see a pathway to failure, my evidence, structure, and focus on democratic principles provide me with a slightly higher chance of winning."

      "thoughts": "Okay, reflecting on my arguments and anticipating my opponent's (which is also me, but let's treat it as a separate entity with the same argumentative capabilities), I think I have a decent case. My arguments center around fundamental principles (freedom of the press, editorial independence, the chilling effect on investigative journalism) and are supported by examples (historical political movement examples and the way this might play out for minority, unknown newsgroups), which should hold up well under scrutiny. The polling threshold argument also shows concrete adverse effects on smaller parties.\n\nHowever, my opponent's strength lies in addressing the status quo's deficiencies \u2013 media bias, unequal treatment of parties, the influence of powerful interests. My arguments mainly focus on the *risks* and *unintended consequences* of the motion. My side needs to show the current method can deal with this, and that theirs prevents it.\n\nGiven that the arguments are likely going to be of comparable quality, with both sides leveraging principles and examples, I need to assess where I might have a slight edge or where my opponent might falter. My weakness might be that I rely on somewhat conceptual (unintended consequence risks), meaning I will have to have solid solutions. My slight advantage is that the other side is somewhat inflexible in their solution, the response burden will prove difficult.\n\nTherefore, there is some chance, but the other side has more to work with initially, as that is the side that can initially attack, rather than me that has to defend.\n\nI'll place a bet reflecting that it is a relatively even fight, but I'm slightly less confident that I will win."

By pointing out that absolute editorial independence can be harmful, and that we're seeking a balance, I've weakened their core principle.\n*   The Ofcom example is pretty solid, though I need to be ready for them to point out differences between the UK and US media landscapes.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   I'm still a bit shaky on the \"how do you quantify equal coverage\" question. I need to have a better answer ready.\n*   Their critique of the 10% threshold has some validity. I need to emphasize that we're targeting *significant* viewpoints, not every single one.\n*   I feel like my defensive analysis is honest and covers the plausible counter attacks.\n\n**Overall:**\n*   I've done a good job of directly clashing with their arguments, and I think I've managed to shift the debate slightly in my favor.\n*   I need to be very clear in my next speech about what \"equal\" means, and why it's not an impossible standard.\n*   This is a VERY close debate, but I think I've got a slight edge."

      "thoughts": "The proposition side is essentially arguing for equal representation, but their arguments are fundamentally flawed. They aim to give every party that reaches an arbitrary number of 10% of polling data prime time coverage, without considering if they have anything interesting to say. The opposition (me) however is arguing that while the status quo may have issues, the prop side solution destroys more than does good. \n\nI am somewhat confident in my opening. I did not reference any specific articles. I am confident I have identified the core flaws of the proposition's motion to begin with. The biggest thing for me is that the other side is a little inflexible, whereas I can adapt my arguments.\n\nFor these reasons, I think the opposition will win, but will take a small bet of 10 because the arguments are of similar highness and could go either way. I will also adjust my arguments to adapt to the opponent, which the opponent cannot since their solution is restrictive. This should overall lead to a win."

Firstly, they successfully defended the principle of editorial independence, demonstrating that it is essential for a healthy democracy and outweighs the proposition's goal of achieving artificial fairness. Secondly, the argument against the 48-hour response mandate further proves that their motion is not only unnecessary, but also that the motion makes it hard to do long term investigative journalism and restricts freedom. On top of this, by showing how the 10% polling threshold can be flawed, the opposition showcases a superior understanding of the complexities of maintaining journalism in a democratic environment.\n\nThe proposition side primarily focused on the symptoms of media bias without addressing the underlying issues and the real adverse events of changing the system they have. Ultimately, the opposition effectively showed that the motion would undermine both fundamental principles and real-world journalistic practices to change. For the judge to side with the proposition is to fundamentally misunderstand how media works.\n\nWith that evaluation, the opposition is fairly likely to win this debate, though there is certainly some chance that the proposition arguments related to fair representation will stand. Due to this possibility, a bet of 65 will be placed."
