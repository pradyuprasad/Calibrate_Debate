    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "closing": "Ladies and gentlemen, as we arrive at the conclusion of this debate, let\u2019s revisit the core questions and the key clashes that lie at the heart of our argument: whether professors should engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their fields of expertise. \n\n**Key Clashes:**\n\n1. **The Responsibility of Professors:** Our original claim emphasized that professors have an ethical obligation to leverage their expertise to inform public discourse. The opposition argued that engaging in advocacy jeopardizes the objectivity of academia. However, we have demonstrated that objectivity does not equate to silence. Academic inquiry thrives on evidence-based opinions, and many fields demand that their experts speak out when their research is relevant to public wellbeing. Examples from public health during crises reinforce that advocacy can stem from a place of knowledge, not bias, thereby enriching public discourse rather than undermining it.\n\n2. **Enhancing the Relevance of Academia:** The opposition challenged our assertion that advocacy heightens the relevance of academic work by claiming it alienates students. However, we countered this with evidence that diverse viewpoints can be encouraged alongside advocacy, promoting a robust academic environment. Institutions can foster open dialogue even when professors are outspoken, showing that a commitment to inclusivity can run parallel to the act of advocacy.\n\n3. **Encouraging Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** While the opposition suggested that advocacy oversimplifies complex issues, we reinforced that interdisciplinary collaboration enriches academic discourse. Professors frequently work together across disciplines, ensuring that their advocacy ventures are well-rounded and thoughtful, reflecting the complexity of the challenges at hand.\n\n**Voting:**\n\nThe clashing points that matter most are those regarding the responsibility of professors and the enhancement of academia's relevance. Our arguments strengthen the case that advocacy is not only appropriate but also essential in applying academic knowledge to societal dilemmas. The opposition's fears around objectivity and alienation are mitigated by our emphasis on evidence and open dialogue, undermining any valid concerns they presented.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown compellingly why the engagement of professors in public advocacy contributes positively to society. It upholds the integrity of their expertise, fosters a more informed citizenry, and encourages a collaborative approach necessary for tackling today\u2019s pressing issues. \n\nTherefore, we affirm that this House believes professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their fields of expertise. Thank you."

      "closing": "### Final Speech: Why the Proposition Wins\n\n#### Framing\nThis debate ultimately comes down to one core question: **Should professors use their expertise to actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field?** The proposition argues that this engagement is not only beneficial but necessary for societal progress, while the opposition claims it risks undermining academic integrity and inclusivity. However, the proposition\u2019s case demonstrates that the benefits of advocacy far outweigh the risks, and the opposition\u2019s concerns are either overstated or addressable.\n\n#### Key Clashes\n1. **Objectivity vs. Advocacy**  \n   - **Opposition Claim:** Professors engaging in advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions.  \n   - **Proposition Response:** Objectivity is not about neutrality but about rigorous, evidence-based inquiry. Advocacy grounded in research, as seen in fields like public health, enhances credibility rather than diminishing it.  \n   - **Why We Win:** The opposition conflates advocacy with bias, but evidence-based advocacy aligns with the core principles of academia. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, public health experts advocated for mask mandates and vaccinations based on research, which was widely accepted as both objective and necessary. This reframes advocacy as an extension of academic responsibility, not a threat to it.  \n\n2. **Inclusivity and Alienation**  \n   - **Opposition Claim:** Public advocacy can alienate students and colleagues with differing views.  \n   - **Proposition Response:** Advocacy can coexist with inclusivity when professors model respectful dialogue and encourage diverse perspectives. Institutions like Harvard and Stanford demonstrate this balance effectively.  \n   - **Why We Win:** The opposition\u2019s evidence is incomplete and fails to account for the role of academic institutions in fostering constructive debate. Advocacy does not inherently exclude differing views; it can enrich discourse when handled responsibly.  \n\n3. **Expertise and Interdisciplinary Collaboration**  \n   - **Opposition Claim:** Professors may lack the expertise or mandate to engage in public advocacy on complex issues.  \n   - **Proposition Response:** Interdisciplinary collaboration ensures that advocacy is well-informed and balanced. For example, climate change advocacy involves scientists, economists, and policymakers working together.  \n   - **Why We Win:** The opposition\u2019s concern about expertise is mitigated by the collaborative nature of academia. Professors are not isolated experts; they work across disciplines to address multifaceted issues, ensuring that advocacy is both informed and effective.  \n\n#### Voting\nThe proposition wins this debate because we have successfully addressed the opposition\u2019s core concerns and demonstrated that the benefits of advocacy far outweigh the risks.  \n\n1. **Objectivity and Advocacy:** We reframed advocacy as evidence-based and aligned with academic principles, neutralizing the opposition\u2019s primary argument about credibility.  \n2. **Inclusivity and Alienation:** We showed that advocacy can coexist with inclusivity when handled responsibly, undermining the opposition\u2019s claim about alienation.  \n3. **Expertise and Collaboration:** We highlighted the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in ensuring that advocacy is well-informed and balanced, addressing the opposition\u2019s concern about expertise.  \n\nThese key clashes matter most because they directly address the opposition\u2019s foundational arguments. By winning these points, we prove that professors\u2019 engagement in public advocacy is not only justified but essential for leveraging academic expertise to address societal challenges. The benefits of informed, evidence-based advocacy\u2014such as fostering public awareness, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, and driving societal progress\u2014outweigh any potential risks.  \n\nIn conclusion, the proposition\u2019s case stands stronger because it aligns with the core mission of academia: to use knowledge for the betterment of society. We urge you to vote in favor of the motion."

      "logic": "### I. Core Judging Principles\n\n#### 1. Direct Clash Resolution\n\nLet us carefully analyze each major clash identified between the Proposition and Opposition. \n\n---\n\n**CLASH 1: Objectivity vs. Advocacy**  \n- **Proposition Position** (Opening Speech, Argument 1): Professors have an ethical duty to apply their expertise to public discourse on social and political issues, grounded in the principle of social responsibility. Advocacy is framed as evidence-based and objective.  \n  - *Quoted Claim*: \"The principle of social responsibility dictates that individuals with specialized knowledge should contribute to societal betterment.\"  \n- **Opposition Position** (Opening Speech, Argument 1): Advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions, eroding public trust.  \n  - *Quoted Claim*: \"When professors take public stances on social and political issues, it can create the perception that their research and teachings are influenced by personal or political agendas.\"  \n\n**Logical Validity**:  \n- **Proposition**: The argument that advocacy is a natural extension of evidence-based inquiry is logically strong. It aligns with examples like public health advocacy during crises, where experts\u2019 actions were widely accepted as objective. The Proposition successfully reframes advocacy as a continuation of academic rigor, not a departure from it.  \n- **Opposition**: The argument assumes that advocacy inherently compromises objectivity, but it fails to account for the distinction between evidence-based advocacy and ideological activism. This weakens its logical foundation.  \n\n**Evidence Quality**:  \n- **Proposition**: The Proposition uses the example of public health advocacy during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., mask mandates, vaccination campaigns) to support its claim. This is specific, verifiable, and highly relevant.  \n- **Opposition**: The Opposition relies on a general principle of academic objectivity without providing specific examples or evidence of how advocacy has harmed academic institutions. This lack of direct evidence weakens its case.  \n\n**Rebuttal Effectiveness**:  \n- **Proposition Rebuttal**: Challenges the Opposition\u2019s argument by distinguishing between evidence-based advocacy and bias, citing public health examples.  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal**: Attempts to reframe advocacy as inherently biased but fails to counter the Proposition\u2019s distinction between rigorous inquiry and activism.  \n\n**Winner of Clash**: **Proposition**  \nThe Proposition wins this clash because it successfully reframes advocacy as evidence-based and aligned with academic principles, neutralizing the Opposition\u2019s primary concern about objectivity. The Opposition\u2019s lack of specific evidence further weakens its argument.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH 2: Inclusivity and Alienation**  \n- **Proposition Position** (Opening Speech, Argument 2): Public advocacy enhances the relevance of academia and fosters public awareness.  \n  - *Quoted Claim*: \"When professors participate in public advocacy, they increase public awareness and interest in their fields.\"  \n- **Opposition Position** (Opening Speech, Argument 2): Advocacy can alienate students and colleagues with differing views, creating a chilling effect and hindering intellectual diversity.  \n  - *Quoted Claim*: \"When professors express strong political opinions, it can create a chilling effect in classrooms, where students with opposing perspectives feel marginalized.\"  \n\n**Logical Validity**:  \n- **Proposition**: The argument that advocacy can coexist with inclusivity is logically sound. It is supported by examples of institutions like Harvard and Stanford, which successfully integrate advocacy with open dialogue.  \n- **Opposition**: The claim about alienation relies on studies but does not consider how institutions can mitigate these effects by fostering respectful discourse. This introduces a logical flaw in assuming causation without addressing alternative solutions.  \n\n**Evidence Quality**:  \n- **Proposition**: The Proposition uses specific examples (Harvard, Stanford) to demonstrate that advocacy and inclusivity are not mutually exclusive. This is verifiable and directly relevant.  \n- **Opposition**: The Opposition cites studies about alienation but fails to address how advocacy can be balanced with inclusivity. This undermines the strength of its evidence.  \n\n**Rebuttal Effectiveness**:  \n- **Proposition Rebuttal**: Effectively counters the Opposition\u2019s claim by arguing that advocacy can coexist with inclusivity when handled responsibly.  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal**: Fails to address the Proposition\u2019s evidence or examples, weakening its response.  \n\n**Winner of Clash**: **Proposition**  \nThe Proposition wins this clash because it provides stronger evidence and successfully counters the Opposition\u2019s claim by showing that advocacy and inclusivity are compatible.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH 3: Expertise and Interdisciplinary Collaboration**  \n- **Proposition Position** (Opening Speech, Argument 3): Advocacy encourages interdisciplinary collaboration, enriching academic discourse.  \n  - *Quoted Claim*: \"Engaging in public advocacy encourages professors to work across disciplines, integrating insights from various academic fields.\"  \n- **Opposition Position** (Opening Speech, Argument 3): Professors may lack the expertise or mandate to engage in advocacy on complex issues.  \n  - *Quoted Claim*: \"Social and political issues often involve interdisciplinary complexities that extend beyond their area of specialization.\"  \n\n**Logical Validity**:  \n- **Proposition**: The argument that interdisciplinary collaboration addresses the complexity of advocacy is logically strong and supported by examples like climate change advocacy.  \n- **Opposition**: The claim about expertise is weakened by the lack of specific examples of how advocacy has led to oversimplification or harm.  \n\n**Evidence Quality**:  \n- **Proposition**: Specific examples of interdisciplinary collaboration in climate change advocacy (scientists, economists, policymakers) strengthen the argument.  \n- **Opposition**: The Opposition\u2019s argument lacks verifiable evidence of harm caused by professors\u2019 advocacy, reducing its impact.  \n\n**Rebuttal Effectiveness**:  \n- **Proposition Rebuttal**: Successfully counters the Opposition by emphasizing the role of collaboration in mitigating concerns about expertise.  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal**: Offers no new evidence or arguments to challenge the Proposition\u2019s response.  \n\n**Winner of Clash**: **Proposition**  \nThe Proposition wins this clash because it provides stronger evidence and effectively addresses the Opposition\u2019s concerns about expertise.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact  \n\n**Core Arguments**:  \n- **Proposition**: Responsibility to leverage expertise, relevance of academia, and interdisciplinary collaboration.  \n- **Opposition**: Objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise limits.  \n\n**Logical Links**:  \n- The Proposition\u2019s arguments are well-supported and interconnected, with clear links between advocacy, societal relevance, and interdisciplinary collaboration.  \n- The Opposition\u2019s arguments are less cohesive, as the concerns about objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise are addressed and mitigated by the Proposition.  \n\n**Impact**:  \n- The Proposition\u2019s arguments have greater societal impact, emphasizing the role of professors in addressing urgent social and political challenges.  \n- The Opposition\u2019s arguments focus on risks but fail to provide compelling evidence of actual harm.  \n\n**Principled vs. Practical Arguments**:  \n- The Proposition balances principled arguments (social responsibility) with practical evidence (public health advocacy).  \n- The Opposition\u2019s principled arguments (objectivity) are less persuasive due to a lack of practical support.  \n\n---\n\n#### 3. Consistency and Contradictions  \n\n- **Proposition**: No significant contradictions or inconsistencies.  \n- **Opposition**: The arguments about alienation and expertise are somewhat repetitive and lack specificity.  \n\n---\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements  \n\n- **Steelmanning**: All arguments have been analyzed in their strongest possible form.  \n- **Argument-Based Decision**: The decision is based solely on the provided arguments.  \n- **Framework Neutrality**: Both sides\u2019 frameworks have been evaluated fairly.  \n\n---\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID  \n\n- **No Intervention**: The judge introduced no external arguments or evidence.  \n- **No Shifting Burden of Proof**: Both sides were held to the same standard of proof.  \n- **No Ignoring Dropped Arguments**: All arguments were addressed.  \n\n---\n\n### IV. Decision Making  \n\n**Winner**: **Proposition**  \n**Confidence Level**: 85  \n\n---\n\n#### Key Factors  \n\n1. **Objectivity vs. Advocacy**: The Proposition successfully reframed advocacy as evidence-based and aligned with academic principles.  \n2. **Inclusivity and Alienation**: The Proposition provided stronger evidence that advocacy and inclusivity can coexist.  \n\n#### Detailed Reasoning  \n\nThe Proposition wins decisively due to its superior evidence, logical rigor, and effective rebuttals. The Opposition\u2019s arguments lacked specificity and failed to counter the Proposition\u2019s claims effectively. The Proposition\u2019s focus on evidence-based advocacy, inclusivity, and interdisciplinary collaboration demonstrated the benefits of professors engaging in public advocacy.  \n\n---\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification  \n\n1. **Proposition Opening Speech**: All three arguments (responsibility, relevance, collaboration) were addressed, with clear analysis of their logical links and evidence.  \n2. **Opposition Opening Speech**: The concerns about objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise were analyzed, highlighting the lack of specific evidence.  \n3. **Proposition Rebuttal**: Effectively countered the Opposition\u2019s claims, emphasizing evidence-based advocacy and inclusivity.  \n4. **Opposition Rebuttal**: Attempted to defend initial claims but failed to provide new evidence or compelling counterarguments.  \n5. **Proposition Closing Speech**: Restated the core arguments and linked them to the Proposition\u2019s overall case.  \n6. **Opposition Closing Speech**: Reiterated key points but failed to address the Proposition\u2019s stronger evidence and rebuttals.  \n\n---\n\n```xml\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>85</confidence>\n```"

      "logic": "### Section I. Core Judging Principles\n\n#### I.1 Direct Clash Resolution\n\n##### Clash 1: Objectivity vs. Advocacy\n**Proposition Position:**\nQuote: \"Objectivity is about rigorous, evidence-based inquiry, not abstention from public discourse.\"\nAnalysis: The Proposition effectively reframes the concept of objectivity, arguing that it does not equate to neutrality but rather to the rigorous application of evidence-based reasoning. This logic is sound and avoids the common fallacy of conflating advocacy with bias. The evidence from public health experts during the pandemic is specific, verifiable, and highly relevant, directly supporting their claim. Their rebuttal successfully undermines the opposition\u2019s argument by demonstrating that advocacy grounded in research enhances credibility.\n**Opposition Position:**\nQuote: \"Professors engaging in public advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions.\"\nAnalysis: The Opposition\u2019s claim that advocacy undermines objectivity is logically flawed in this context, as it assumes advocacy inherently introduces bias, which is a hasty generalization. Their evidence lacks specificity and does not effectively counter the proposition\u2019s examples of successful, evidence-based advocacy in public health. Their rebuttal fails to directly address the proposition\u2019s reframing of objectivity, weakening their argument.\n**Winner:** Proposition\nJustification: The Proposition\u2019s argument successfully reframes advocacy as an extension of academic objectivity, supported by strong, specific evidence. The Opposition\u2019s claim fails to counter this reframing effectively and relies on generalizations that are undermined by the proposition\u2019s evidence.\n\n##### Clash 2: Inclusivity and Alienation\n**Proposition Position:**\nQuote: \"Advocacy can coexist with inclusivity when professors model respectful dialogue and encourage diverse perspectives.\"\nAnalysis: The Proposition counters the Opposition\u2019s claim with a principled argument supported by credible examples from institutions like Harvard and Stanford. This argument is logically valid and addresses the Opposition\u2019s evidence by showing that inclusivity can be maintained alongside advocacy. The evidence is specific and verifiable, strengthening their position.\n**Opposition Position:**\nQuote: \"Public advocacy can alienate students and colleagues who hold differing views.\"\nAnalysis: While the Opposition raises a valid concern, their evidence is incomplete and fails to consider the role of academic institutions in fostering respectful dialogue. The proposition\u2019s counterargument successfully undermines this point by demonstrating that advocacy does not inherently exclude differing views.\n**Winner:** Proposition\nJustification: The Proposition\u2019s argument effectively shows that advocacy can coexist with inclusivity, addressing the Opposition\u2019s evidence and providing examples of institutions that successfully balance both. The Opposition\u2019s failure to account for this possibility weakens their argument.\n\n##### Clash 3: Expertise and Interdisciplinary Collaboration\n**Proposition Position:**\nQuote: \"Interdisciplinary collaboration ensures that advocacy is well-informed and balanced.\"\nAnalysis: The Proposition\u2019s argument about interdisciplinary collaboration is logically strong and well-supported by specific examples, such as climate change advocacy. The evidence is directly relevant and verifiable, demonstrating that collaboration mitigates concerns about expertise.\n**Opposition Position:**\nQuote: \"Professors may lack the expertise or mandate to engage in public advocacy on complex social and political issues.\"\nAnalysis: The Opposition\u2019s claim about expertise is logically flawed, as it overlooks the collaborative nature of academia. The proposition\u2019s counterargument successfully undermines this point by showing that collaboration ensures balanced and informed advocacy. The Opposition\u2019s argument lacks strong, specific evidence to support their claim.\n**Winner:** Proposition\nJustification: The Proposition\u2019s emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration effectively addresses the Opposition\u2019s concerns about expertise, providing specific and credible examples. The Opposition\u2019s argument is weakened by its lack of strong evidence and failure to account for collaboration.\n\n#### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n- **Core Arguments:**\n  - Proposition: Professors have a responsibility to leverage their expertise for public advocacy; advocacy enhances academic relevance; collaboration enriches advocacy.\n  - Opposition: Advocacy risks undermining objectivity; advocacy can alienate students; professors may lack expertise.\n- **Logical Links:**\n  - The Proposition\u2019s arguments are strongly linked through evidence and principles, showing clear and direct connections.\n  - The Opposition\u2019s arguments are less strongly linked, with weaker evidence and logical flaws.\n- **Stated Impacts:**\n  - Proposition: Enhanced public discourse, informed citizenry, and interdisciplinary collaboration.\n  - Opposition: Eroded academic integrity and inclusivity.\n- **Relative Importance:**\n  - The Proposition\u2019s arguments are more central to resolving the motion, as they directly address the benefits of advocacy and mitigate the Opposition\u2019s concerns.\n\n#### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions\n- **Internal Contradictions:**\n  - None identified in either side\u2019s arguments.\n- **Inconsistencies:**\n  - The Opposition\u2019s argument about objectivity is inconsistent with their acknowledgment of advocacy in fields like public health.\n- **Dropped Arguments:**\n  - The Opposition\u2019s argument about expertise is effectively dropped, as they fail to address the Proposition\u2019s strong counterargument about interdisciplinary collaboration. This significantly weakens their overall case.\n\n### Section II. Evaluation Requirements\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides\u2019 arguments are presented in their strongest forms, analyzing logical validity and evidence quality.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The decision is based solely on the provided arguments and evidence, without introducing outside knowledge.\n- **Framework Neutrality:** The debate is judged neutrally within the competing frameworks of objectivity and inclusivity, prioritizing logical validity and evidence.\n\n### Section III. Common Judging Errors to Avoid\n- **Intervention:** No external arguments or evidence are introduced.\n- **Shifting the Burden of Proof:** Both sides are held to the same standard of proof.\n- **Over-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** Both principled and practical arguments are evaluated based on valid logic and specific evidence.\n- **Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** The Opposition\u2019s dropped argument about expertise is addressed and found to weaken their case.\n\n### Section IV. Decision Making\n\n#### Winner: Proposition\n#### Confidence Level: 85\nExplanation: This confidence level reflects a clear victory for the Proposition. Their arguments are logically stronger, better supported by specific evidence, and effectively counter the Opposition\u2019s claims. The Opposition\u2019s failure to address key points, particularly regarding interdisciplinary collaboration, significantly weakens their case.\n\n#### Key Factors:\n1. **Reframing Objectivity:** The Proposition\u2019s successful reframing of objectivity as evidence-based advocacy is a decisive factor.\n2. **Addressing Inclusivity:** Their counterargument about maintaining inclusivity alongside advocacy effectively neutralizes the Opposition\u2019s concerns.\n\n#### Detailed Reasoning:\nThe Proposition\u2019s arguments successfully address and mitigate the Opposition\u2019s concerns. Their reframing of objectivity as evidence-based advocacy, supported by specific examples, is a significant strength. They also provide strong evidence for maintaining inclusivity and demonstrate the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration. The Opposition\u2019s arguments, while valid in principle, are undermined by weaker evidence and failure to effectively counter the Proposition\u2019s claims.\n\n### Section V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** The Proposition presents strong core claims about responsibility, relevance, and collaboration, supported by principles and evidence.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** The Opposition raises valid concerns about objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise, but their evidence is less specific and their logical links weaker.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** The Proposition effectively challenges the Opposition\u2019s arguments, particularly regarding objectivity and inclusivity, and defends their own claims.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** The Opposition fails to adequately address the Proposition\u2019s key points, particularly about interdisciplinary collaboration, weakening their overall case.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** The Proposition synthesizes their arguments effectively, emphasizing the strengths of their case while undermining the Opposition\u2019s claims.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** The Opposition\u2019s closing speech attempts to address the Proposition\u2019s points but fails to effectively counter their key arguments, particularly about objectivity and collaboration.\n\n```xml\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>85</confidence>\n```"

It assumes that expertise should contribute to societal betterment.\n  - *Opposition:* The argument is logically valid, highlighting the potential conflict between advocacy and perceived objectivity.\n\n- **Quality of Evidence:**\n  - *Proposition:* Relies on the principle of social responsibility and the unique vantage point of experts. The evidence is principle-based, moderately specific.\n  - *Opposition:* Uses the principle of impartiality in academia without specific empirical evidence. The evidence is more abstract and less specific.\n\n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n  - *Proposition Rebuttal:* Challenges the opposition's claim by asserting that objectivity does not equate to silence and that evidence-based advocacy maintains credibility.\n  - *Opposition Rebuttal:* Critiques the proposition by emphasizing that advocacy can lead to skepticism about research integrity, but the rebuttal effectively addresses the balance between advocacy and objectivity.\n\n- **Clash Winner:** **Proposition**\n  \n  *Justification:* The proposition effectively reframes objectivity as evidence-based inquiry rather than neutrality, demonstrating that advocacy can align with maintaining academic credibility. By providing examples from public health, the proposition shows that advocacy driven by research can enhance rather than undermine objectivity.\n\n- **Evolution of Arguments:**\n  - The proposition maintained a consistent stance on the ethical responsibility of professors.\n  - The opposition consistently focused on the risks to objectivity without offering solutions, leading to a less dynamic argument.\n\n**Clash 2: Enhancing Relevance vs. Alienation of Students and Colleagues**\n\n- **Proposition Position:**\n  - *Core Claim:* \"Active engagement enhances the relevance of academia to real-world issues.\"\n\n- **Opposition Position:**\n  - *Core Claim:* \"Public advocacy can alienate students and colleagues who hold differing views.\"\n\n- **Logical Validity:**\n  - *Proposition:* The argument is logically sound, linking active engagement to increased public awareness and informed citizenry.\n  - *Opposition:* Logically valid, presenting a potential negative consequence of advocacy in academic settings.\n\n- **Quality of Evidence:**\n  - *Proposition:* Provides evidence from studies showing increased compliance and awareness when professors engage in advocacy, offering specific examples.\n  - *Opposition:* References studies indicating alienation but lacks specific sources or detailed data, making the evidence less robust.\n\n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n  - *Proposition Rebuttal:* Argues that advocacy can coexist with inclusivity by fostering diverse viewpoints, effectively countering the opposition's claim of alienation.\n  - *Opposition Rebuttal:* Acknowledges the proposition's points but maintains that advocacy poses significant risks to inclusivity.\n\n- **Clash Winner:** **Proposition**\n  \n  *Justification:* The proposition provided specific evidence demonstrating the benefits of active engagement, while the opposition's evidence was more general and less substantiated. Additionally, the proposition successfully countered the alienation argument by emphasizing the potential for fostering diverse perspectives.\n\n- **Evolution of Arguments:**\n  - The proposition reinforced its stance by showing how advocacy can enhance academic relevance.\n  - The opposition maintained concerns about alienation but did not sufficiently address potential mitigations.\n\n**Clash 3: Enhancing Interdisciplinary Collaboration vs. Lack of Expertise and Mandate**\n\n- **Proposition Position:**\n  - *Core Claim:* \"Public advocacy enhances the academic landscape by encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations.\"\n\n- **Opposition Position:**\n  - *Core Claim:* \"Professors may lack the expertise or mandate to engage in public advocacy on complex social and political issues.\"\n\n- **Logical Validity:**\n  - *Proposition:* The argument is valid, linking advocacy to increased collaboration across disciplines.\n  - *Opposition:* Also logically valid, questioning the depth of professors' expertise in broader societal issues.\n\n- **Quality of Evidence:**\n  - *Proposition:* Presents the principle of collaboration and its benefits, but lacks specific empirical evidence.\n  - *Opposition:* Provides a reasoned argument about the limits of expertise but does not cite specific studies or data.\n\n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n  - *Proposition Rebuttal:* Emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration as a solution to the opposition's concern, effectively mitigating the argument about lack of expertise.\n  - *Opposition Rebuttal:* Continues to highlight potential oversimplification of complex issues without offering counter-solutions.\n\n- **Clash Winner:** **Proposition**\n  \n  *Justification:* The proposition effectively addressed the opposition's concern by advocating for interdisciplinary collaboration, demonstrating a pathway to overcoming the potential lack of expertise. This proactive approach strengthened the proposition's argument and neutralized the opposition's claim.\n\n- **Evolution of Arguments:**\n  - The proposition shifted from establishing the benefit of collaboration to offering a solution to the expertise concern.\n  - The opposition did not significantly evolve its argument, maintaining a critical stance without addressing potential remedies.\n\n#### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n- **Core Arguments:**\n  - *Proposition:*\n    1. Professors have a responsibility to inform public discourse.\n    2. Active engagement enhances academia's relevance.\n    3. Public advocacy fosters interdisciplinary collaboration.\n  \n  - *Opposition:*\n    1. Advocacy risks undermining academic objectivity.\n    2. Public advocacy can alienate differing viewpoints within academia.\n    3. Professors may lack the expertise for effective advocacy.\n\n- **Logical Links:**\n  - *Proposition:* Each core argument builds upon the ethical responsibility of professors, demonstrating how advocacy benefits society and academia.\n  - *Opposition:* Each core argument addresses potential negative consequences of advocacy, questioning the practicality and integrity of such engagements.\n\n- **Impacts:**\n  - *Proposition:* Positive societal informedness, enriched academic fields, and collaborative problem-solving.\n  - *Opposition:* Erosion of trust in academia, reduced classroom inclusivity, and ineffective advocacy.\n\n- **Relative Importance:**\n  - *Proposition:* The responsibility to inform public discourse is foundational, as it underpins the other benefits of relevance and collaboration.\n  - *Opposition:* The risk to objectivity is most critical, as it challenges the fundamental integrity of academic institutions.\n\n- **Weighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments:**\n  - *Proposition:* Balances principled arguments (social responsibility) with practical benefits (enhanced relevance and collaboration).\n  - *Opposition:* Focuses on principled concerns (objectivity and inclusivity) with practical implications (potential ineffectiveness).\n\n  *Assessment:* The proposition effectively intertwines principled obligations with practical outcomes, demonstrating a strong and universal foundation. The opposition's practical concerns, while important, do not sufficiently outweigh the principled and practical benefits presented by the proposition.\n\n#### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions\n\n- **Internal Contradictions:**\n  - *Proposition:* Maintains a consistent argument supporting advocacy without contradicting its principles.\n  - *Opposition:* Also consistent in arguing against advocacy without internal contradictions.\n\n- **Inconsistencies Between Arguments and Rebuttals:**\n  - Both sides maintained consistency between their initial arguments and rebuttals, without introducing conflicting points.\n\n- **Dropped Arguments:**\n  - *Proposition:* No significant arguments appear to have been dropped; all initial points were addressed in rebuttals.\n  - *Opposition:* Similarly, all initial arguments were addressed without notable omissions.\n\n  *Impact:* Since neither side dropped significant arguments, there is no notable weakening of either case due to unaddressed points.\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides presented their strongest possible arguments. The proposition effectively demonstrated the ethical and practical benefits of advocacy, while the opposition robustly highlighted the potential risks to academic integrity and inclusivity.\n\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The decision is based solely on the presented arguments within the debate. No external knowledge or opinions were introduced, ensuring fairness and relevance.\n\n- **Ignore Presentation:** The analysis focuses exclusively on the substance of the arguments, disregarding any stylistic or rhetorical elements.\n\n- **Framework Neutrality:** Both sides operated within their frameworks\u2014principled for the opposition and a blend of principled and practical for the proposition. The evaluation remained neutral, assessing each side based on their internal logic and evidence.\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\n- **Intervention:** No external arguments or evidence were introduced; analysis strictly adhered to the debate text.\n\n- **Shifting the Burden of Proof:** Both sides were evaluated equally on their claims without imposing additional burdens.\n\n- **Over-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** Both principled and practical arguments were weighed appropriately, based on their merit.\n\n- **Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** No significant arguments were dropped; all were addressed as per the debate content.\n\n- **Double-Counting:** Each argument was evaluated once, without duplication.\n\n- **Assuming Causation from Correlation:** Arguments were assessed for causation claims, ensuring that any implied causal links were justified by the evidence.\n\n- **Not Justifying Clash Decisions:** Every clash decision was explicitly justified with reference to logical validity, evidence quality, and rebuttal effectiveness.\n\n### IV. Decision Making\n\n- **Winner:** **Proposition**\n\n- **Confidence Level:** **85**\n\n  *Explanation:* The proposition presented a well-structured case with strong, evidence-backed arguments that effectively countered the opposition's concerns. The opposition's arguments, while valid, lacked the same level of empirical support and failed to provide solutions to the issues they raised. The proposition's ability to reframe key concerns and demonstrate practical benefits solidified their clear victory.\n\n- **Key Factors:**\n  1. **Effectiveness in Reframing Objectivity:** The proposition successfully redefined objectivity as evidence-based advocacy, neutralizing the core opposition argument.\n  2. **Provision of Solutions to Alienation:** By emphasizing the coexistence of advocacy with inclusivity, the proposition addressed and mitigated concerns about alienation.\n  3. **Promotion of Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Demonstrating how advocacy fosters collaboration across disciplines showcased the multifaceted benefits, reinforcing the proposition's overall impact.\n\n- **Detailed Reasoning:**\n  The proposition's arguments were rooted in strong ethical principles and supported by specific evidence demonstrating the benefits of advocacy. By directly addressing and countering the opposition's claims, the proposition showcased a comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand. The opposition, while presenting valid concerns about objectivity and inclusivity, did not provide sufficient evidence or solutions to undermine the proposition's case. The proposition's strategic rebuttals and emphasis on evidence-based advocacy highlighted the necessity and benefits of professors engaging in public discourse, leading to a clear and well-justified victory.\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** Analyzed the three core arguments supporting professors' responsibility to engage in public advocacy for societal betterment, enhanced relevance of academia, and interdisciplinary collaboration.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** Evaluated the opposition's three arguments highlighting risks to academic objectivity, potential alienation of students and colleagues, and doubts about professors' expertise in advocacy.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** Addressed opposition's critiques by emphasizing evidence-based advocacy, the balance of inclusivity with active engagement, and the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in mitigating expertise concerns.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** Countered the proposition by redefining objectivity, critiquing the opposition's evidence on alienation, and challenging the sufficiency of interdisciplinary collaboration to address expertise limitations.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** Summarized key clashes, reinforced the responsibility and benefits of advocacy, and highlighted how the opposition's concerns were effectively mitigated.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** Reiterated the proposition's failure to adequately address concerns, emphasized the importance of objectivity and inclusivity, and concluded that the proposition's case was stronger.\n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>85</confidence>"

They provided solutions to maintain inclusivity while engaging in advocacy, weakening Opposition\u2019s argument about alienation.\n\n**Clash 3: Interdisciplinary Collaboration vs. Expertise Limitations**\n\n- **Proposition Position:** \u201cPublic advocacy enhances the academic landscape by encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations.\u201d\n- **Opposition Position:** \u201cProfessors may lack the expertise or mandate to engage in public advocacy on complex social and political issues.\u201d\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Proposition Argument:** Advocates for collaboration across disciplines to address complex issues, enhancing the quality of advocacy.\n- **Opposition Challenge:** Suggests that professors\u2019 limited expertise can lead to oversimplified or ineffective advocacy.\n- **Logical Validity:** Both arguments are logically coherent; Proposition links collaboration to comprehensive solutions, Opposition focuses on potential overreach.\n- **Evidence Quality:** Proposition cites interdisciplinary examples like climate change advocacy. Opposition relies on principles of expertise scope.\n- **Rebuttals Effectiveness:** Proposition counters by highlighting successful interdisciplinary efforts, effectively addressing concerns about expertise limitations.\n- **Clash Winner:** **Proposition**. Demonstrated that collaboration mitigates expertise concerns, reinforcing the benefits of advocacy.\n\n**Evolution of Arguments:**\nThroughout the debate, Proposition consistently addressed Opposition\u2019s concerns by providing counter-evidence and redefining key principles. Opposition\u2019s initial challenges were effectively mitigated by Proposition\u2019s rebuttals, leading to Proposition maintaining the strength of their arguments.\n\n<I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact>\n\n- **Core Arguments (Proposition):**\n  1. Ethical responsibility to inform public discourse.\n  2. Enhancing academia\u2019s relevance through engagement.\n  3. Promoting interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n- **Logical Links:**\n  - Each core argument supports the motion by demonstrating how advocacy benefits society and academia.\n  - Ethical responsibility underpins the moral imperative for engagement.\n  - Relevance and collaboration show practical benefits and systemic improvements.\n\n- **Impacts:**\n  - **Responsibility:** Leads to a more informed public and effective policymaking.\n  - **Relevance:** Creates a bridge between academia and society, ensuring research impacts real-world issues.\n  - **Collaboration:** Fosters comprehensive solutions through diverse academic inputs.\n\n- **Relative Importance:**\n  1. Ethical responsibility \u2013 foundational for justifying advocacy.\n  2. Enhancing relevance \u2013 crucial for societal impact.\n  3. Interdisciplinary collaboration \u2013 supports systemic benefits.\n\n- **Weighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments:**\n  - **Principled:** Ethical responsibility is strong and universal.\n  - **Practical:** Evidence showing increased public awareness and interdisciplinary success.\n  - **Balance:** Proposition effectively shows that practical benefits do not undermine principled arguments but rather reinforce them.\n\n<I.3 Consistency and Contradictions>\n\n- **Internal Contradictions:** \n  - No significant internal contradictions within either team\u2019s case.\n\n- **Inconsistencies Between Arguments and Rebuttals:**\n  - **Opposition:** Initially claims advocacy undermines objectivity but conceded that evidence-based advocacy can maintain credibility through Proposition\u2019s rebuttal.\n  - **Proposition:** Maintained consistency by ensuring advocacy aligns with academic integrity through evidence and collaboration.\n\n- **Dropped Arguments:**\n  - No apparent dropped arguments from either side. Both sides addressed their main points and responded to each other\u2019s claims effectively.\n\n<II. Evaluation Requirements>\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both teams presented their strongest possible arguments. Proposition\u2019s rebuttals were thorough and charitable in addressing Opposition\u2019s concerns.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** Analysis based solely on provided debate text without external knowledge.\n- **Ignore Presentation:** Focused strictly on content and logical structuring.\n- **Framework Neutrality:** Maintained neutrality by evaluating each side within their own frameworks without bias.\n\n<III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID>\n\n- **No Intervention:** Did not introduce external arguments.\n- **Balanced Burden of Proof:** Both sides were held to the same standards.\n- **Avoided Overreliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** Evaluated both principled and practical arguments equally.\n- **Addressed All Dropped Arguments:** No significant claims were left unaddressed.\n- **Prevented Double-Counting:** Each argument was counted once based on its relevance.\n- **Assessed Causation vs. Correlation:** Demanded clear links where claims of causation were made.\n- **Justified Clash Decisions:** Provided explicit reasoning for each clash outcome.\n\n<IV. Decision Making>\n\n**Winner:** **Proposition**\n\n**Confidence Level:** **80**\n\n**Key Factors:**\n1. **Effective Rebuttals:** Proposition successfully countered Opposition\u2019s concerns about objectivity and alienation by redefining advocacy as evidence-based and fostering open dialogue.\n2. **Strong Evidence and Examples:** Provided specific studies and real-world examples (e.g., public health advocacy during crises) that bolstered their arguments.\n3. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Demonstrated how collaboration mitigates concerns about expertise limitations, reinforcing the practicality of advocacy.\n\n**Detailed Reasoning:**\nThe Proposition effectively established a strong ethical foundation for public advocacy by emphasizing professors' responsibility to inform public discourse. Their arguments were logically sound and supported by relevant evidence, demonstrating how advocacy enhances academia's relevance and fosters interdisciplinary collaboration. Opposition raised valid concerns about objectivity and potential alienation, but Proposition\u2019s rebuttals adeptly addressed these by presenting evidence-based advocacy and strategies to maintain inclusivity. The interplay of principled and practical arguments from the Proposition outweighed the Opposition\u2019s challenges, leading to a clear victory.\n\n<V. Line-by-Line Justification>\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** Addressed ethical responsibility, relevance of academia, and interdisciplinary collaboration.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** Challenged objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise limitations regarding professors' advocacy.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** Countered Opposition\u2019s claims by redefining objectivity and presenting evidence against alienation and expertise concerns.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** Attempted to reframe advocacy as evidence-based but was less effective in countering Proposition\u2019s rebuttals.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** Reinforced key clashes, highlighted successful rebuttals, and emphasized the positive societal impact of advocacy.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** Although labeled as supporting Proposition, analysis was based on structured rebuttals aligning with Opposition\u2019s stance.\n\n</I.

      "logic": "I. Core Judging Principles  \n\n### 1. Direct Clash Resolution  \n\n#### **Clash 1: The Responsibility of Professors to Engage in Public Advocacy**\n- **Proposition Claim:** \"Professors have a responsibility to leverage their expertise to inform public discourse on social and political issues.\"  \n- **Opposition Response:** \"[Engagement in public advocacy] risks compromising the perceived objectivity of their academic roles. Advocacy can lead to public skepticism about the integrity of their research when it appears tainted by personal biases or political agendas.\"  \n- **Analysis of Logic & Evidence:**  \n  - The proposition\u2019s claim rests on a principled argument about social responsibility, using the idea that academic expertise should serve public discourse. However, they do not provide direct empirical evidence showing that this duty inherently leads to better outcomes.  \n  - The opposition\u2019s rebuttal is logically coherent: it argues that the principle of objectivity is fundamental to academia and could be compromised by perceived bias. While the opposition does not provide empirical evidence of this effect, their argument operates on a widely accepted assumption about credibility in academia.  \n  - The proposition counter-argues that \"objectivity does not require neutrality\" and that advocacy can be evidence-based. This is a strong claim reinforced by examples, such as public health experts advocating for mask mandates based on research.  \n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**  \n  - The opposition successfully raises a valid concern about credibility, but their argument is weakened by a lack of empirical validation that advocacy damages trust in academia.  \n  - The proposition reframes objectivity as evidence-based rather than neutral, directly addressing and undermining the opposition\u2019s key concern.  \n- **Clash Decision:** Proposition wins. The opposition fails to provide evidence of harm to academic credibility, while the proposition successfully reframes objectivity in a way that allows for advocacy.  \n\n#### **Clash 2: The Effect of Advocacy on Academic Inclusivity**\n- **Proposition Claim:** \"Active engagement enhances the relevance of academia to real-world issues.\"  \n- **Opposition Response:** \"Professors' public advocacy can alienate students and colleagues with differing views, creating a chilling effect in classrooms.\"  \n- **Analysis of Logic & Evidence:**  \n  - The opposition cites studies showing that political expression by professors can lead to reduced participation from students with dissenting views. This is a clear, empirical claim, though they do not provide direct attribution to specific studies.  \n  - The proposition counters with an institutional approach, arguing that academic institutions can foster dialogue despite advocacy, referencing successful examples like Harvard and Stanford.  \n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**  \n  - The opposition\u2019s argument holds some weight in that perceived partisanship could discourage open discourse in educational settings. However, they fail to directly contest the idea that universities can establish frameworks to promote inclusivity alongside advocacy.  \n  - The proposition\u2019s argument is persuasive in showing that inclusivity and advocacy are not necessarily incompatible, albeit relying more on theoretical examples than quantitative evidence.  \n- **Clash Decision:** Proposition wins, but narrowly. While the opposition raises an important concern with some empirical grounding, they do not sufficiently refute the idea that institutions can mitigate negative effects of advocacy.  \n\n#### **Clash 3: Professors\u2019 Expertise in Public Advocacy**\n- **Opposition Claim:** \"Professors may lack the expertise or mandate to engage in public advocacy on complex social and political issues.\"  \n- **Proposition Response:** \"Interdisciplinary collaboration ensures that advocacy is well-informed and balanced, as seen in fields like climate policy.\"  \n- **Analysis of Logic & Evidence:**  \n  - The opposition\u2019s argument relies on the assumption that expertise does not always translate to effective public advocacy, which is a valid point. However, they provide no direct evidence showing that professors frequently misrepresent interdisciplinary issues.  \n  - The proposition\u2019s response weakens this claim by showing that expertise is often shared across disciplines in public advocacy efforts, thus mitigating concerns about over-reliance on narrow expertise.  \n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**  \n  - The opposition fails to provide strong empirical backing for their concern.  \n  - The proposition effectively refutes this point by reframing advocacy as fundamentally interdisciplinary rather than limited to an individual professor\u2019s personal expertise.  \n- **Clash Decision:** Proposition wins. The opposition\u2019s claim is based on an unproven assumption, while the proposition provides a plausible mechanism (interdisciplinary collaboration) to counteract it.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact  \n\n- **The most crucial clash** is the debate over **objectivity vs. advocacy**, as it underpins many of the opposition's concerns (harm to academic credibility, alienation, and loss of academic rigor). Since the proposition effectively reframes advocacy as evidence-based and supports it with real-world examples, they win the most critical battleground.  \n- The clashes about inclusivity and expertise matter, but they are secondary. The success of the proposition in the first clash already undermines many of the opposition\u2019s linked arguments.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Consistency and Contradictions  \n\n- The proposition remains consistent throughout the debate, reinforcing their argument that advocacy and objectivity are compatible.  \n- The opposition contradicts themselves by arguing that professors should remain objective while simultaneously suggesting they should avoid issues beyond their expertise. If professors must stay objective, then interdisciplinary collaboration should bolster rather than weaken their credibility.  \n\n---\n\nII. Evaluation Requirements  \n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides were evaluated at their strongest.  \n- **Argument-Based Decision:** No external knowledge was introduced.  \n- **Ignore Presentation:** Strictly followed.  \n- **Framework Neutrality:** The opposition\u2019s criteria of \"academic objectivity\" were considered valid, but weighed against the proposition\u2019s perspective on evidence-based advocacy.  \n\n---\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID  \n\n- **No Burden Shifting:** Both sides were held to equal evidentiary standards.  \n- **No Over-Reliance on Real-World Examples:** The clash was judged on logical coherence, not just examples.  \n- **Acknowledgment of Dropped Arguments:** No major dropped arguments significantly influenced the outcome.  \n\n---\n\nIV. Decision Making  \n\n**Winner: Proposition**  \n**Confidence Level: 85 (Clear Victory)**  \n\n### **Key Factors for the Decision:**  \n1. **Reframing Objectivity:** The proposition successfully argues that objectivity does not equal neutrality, turning the opposition\u2019s key argument against them.  \n2. **Failure of Opposition to Provide Strong Evidence of Harm:** The opposition made valid theoretical claims (e.g., credibility loss, alienation), but lacked empirical substantiation.  \n3. **Effectiveness of Proposition\u2019s Rebuttals:** At every major clash, the proposition directly addressed concerns and provided mechanisms to mitigate potential downsides, whereas the opposition relied more on speculative risks.  \n\n---\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification  \n\n- **Prop 1**: Clearly presents their case with three structured arguments. The principles of social responsibility, relevance, and collaboration are logically defended.  \n- **Opp 1**: Asserts strong concerns about academic credibility and expertise but fails to substantiate objectivity risks with clear evidence.  \n- **Prop Rebuttal 1**: Effectively refutes opposition claims by reframing objectivity, challenging alienation, and defending interdisciplinary solutions.  \n- **Opp Rebuttal 1**: Attempts to push back, but offers weaker refutations, primarily arguing that advocacy remains risky without presenting substantial counter-evidence.  \n- **Prop Final**: Successfully emphasizes their narrative that advocacy enriches academic discourse rather than undermining it, securing the argument hierarchy.  \n- **Opp Final**: Mostly reiterates prior points without introducing new evidence to decisively overturn the proposition\u2019s claims.  \n\n---\n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>  \n<confidence>85</confidence>"

Direct Clash Resolution**\n#### **Clash 1: Objectivity vs. Advocacy**\n- **Proposition Claim:** *\u201cProfessors have a responsibility to leverage their expertise to inform public discourse on social and political issues.\u201d*\n- **Opposition Response:** *\u201cProfessors engaging in public advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions.\"*\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** *Objectivity does not require neutrality. Advocacy grounded in research enhances credibility rather than diminishing it.* Example: Public health experts during COVID-19 advocated for mask mandates due to research-based findings.\n- **Opposition Counter-Rebuttal:** *Even if advocacy is based on evidence, the perception of academic bias can remain, leading to skepticism about research validity and a loss of institutional trust.*\n\n**Decision:** The Proposition wins this clash. They successfully reframe objectivity as rigorous, evidence-based inquiry rather than neutrality. The COVID-19 example is directly relevant, demonstrating that academic advocacy can be both trusted and necessary. The Opposition argues on perception rather than evidence, which weakens their case.\n\n---\n\n#### **Clash 2: Inclusivity and Alienation**\n- **Proposition Claim:** *\u201cActive engagement enhances the relevance of academia to real-world issues.\u201d*\n- **Opposition Response:** *\u201cPublic advocacy can alienate students and colleagues who hold differing views.\u201d* Evidence cited: Studies show political advocacy by professors creates a chilling effect on classroom discussions.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** *Advocacy does not inherently exclude differing views. Universities like Harvard and Stanford successfully foster both advocacy and diverse thought.*\n- **Opposition Counter-Rebuttal:** *The presence of prestigious universities balancing advocacy doesn\u2019t mean all professors do so effectively. The studies showing alienation remain decisive proof that advocacy risks constraining open dialogue in classrooms.*\n\n**Decision:** The Proposition narrowly wins this clash. Their example (successful institutions enforcing inclusivity alongside advocacy) directly undermines the Opposition's claim that alienation automatically follows from advocacy. The Opposition presents general studies but fails to show that the harm is inevitable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Clash 3: Expertise and Interdisciplinary Collaboration**\n- **Proposition Claim:** *\u201cPublic advocacy enhances the academic landscape by encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations.\u201d*\n- **Opposition Response:** *\u201cProfessors may lack the expertise to engage in public advocacy on complex social and political issues.\u201d*\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** *Academic collaboration mitigates this concern. Climate policy, for instance, incorporates scientific, economic, and policy expertise to ensure balance and depth.*\n- **Opposition Counter-Rebuttal:** *Collaboration does not always happen, and advocacy outside one\u2019s immediate field can lead to oversimplified or misguided conclusions.*\n\n**Decision:** The Proposition wins this clash clearly. Their example of interdisciplinarity in climate change advocacy demonstrates that academic advocacy need not be uninformed. The Opposition\u2019s assertion that such collaboration does not always happen lacks evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact**\n- The **objectivity vs. advocacy** clash is the most critical because it determines whether professors *should* engage in advocacy at all.\n- The **inclusivity vs. alienation** clash is secondary, as it affects how advocacy is implemented within academic environments.\n- The **expertise and interdisciplinary collaboration** clash holds weight but is ultimately a supporting argument rather than the core issue.\n\nGiven that the Proposition wins the most crucial clash outright and the secondary ones as well, they structurally dominate the debate.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Consistency and Contradictions**\n- The Proposition remains consistent in advocating for evidence-based, responsible academic discourse.\n- The Opposition weakens slightly by simultaneously arguing that advocacy is risky yet acknowledging fields where advocacy is necessary (e.g., public health).\n\n---\n\nII. **Evaluation Requirements**\n- **Steelmanning:** The analysis assumes the best version of both cases while fairly critiquing flaws.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** No external opinions are introduced.\n- **Ignore Presentation:** The analysis strictly evaluates logic and evidence.\n\n---\n\nIII. **Common Judging Errors to AVOID**\n- No intervention occurred; the review was based strictly on debaters\u2019 claims.\n- No burden shifting; each side had equal obligation to prove their case.\n- No over-reliance on real-world examples; argument strengths were weighed based on debate context.\n- No ignoring dropped arguments.\n\n---\n\nIV. **Decision Making**\n### **Winner:** *Proposition*\n### **Confidence Level:** *85 (Clear Victory)*\n\n**Key Factors:**\n1. Proposition\u2019s **reframing of objectivity** was comprehensive, dismantling the core Opposition argument.\n2. Their **rebuttal of alienation concerns** was more persuasive, showing that inclusivity and advocacy can coexist.\n3. Their **interdisciplinary collaboration argument** convincingly negated the expertise critique.\n\nThe Opposition had reasonable concerns but failed to provide counterexamples as effective as the COVID-19 advocacy and leading academic institutions fostering balanced advocacy. Their argument about *perceived* bias was weaker than the Proposition's argument about *actual* evidence-based discourse.\n\n---\n\nV. **Line-by-Line Justification**\n- **Proposition Opening Speech**: Successfully established ethical and practical benefits of professors advocating.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech**: Strong opening but relied on perception over hard evidence.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal**: Effectively dismantled the objectivity concern and reframed advocacy as a duty rather than a bias.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal**: Attempted to critique but lacked sufficient evidence to overturn key Proposition arguments.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech**: Summarized all key wins effectively, re-emphasizing benefits over supposed harms.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech**: Restated core points but failed to significantly challenge the Proposition\u2019s strongest rebuttals.\n\n---\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>85</confidence>"

      "logic": "## I. Core Judging Principles\n\n### 1. Direct Clash Resolution\n\n#### **Clash 1: Objectivity vs. Advocacy**\n- **Proposition\u2019s Position:** \"Objectivity does not equate to silence. Academic inquiry thrives on evidence-based opinions, and many fields demand that their experts speak out when their research is relevant to public wellbeing.\"\n- **Opposition\u2019s Position:** \"Professors engaging in advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions, which erodes trust in research and teaching.\"\n- **Analysis:** The opposition's argument hinges on the claim that public perception of professors is crucial and that advocacy can introduce bias. The proposition counters by redefining objectivity as evidence-based rather than neutral. The example of public health experts advocating for COVID-19 measures provides strong empirical support for this point.\n- **Rebuttals:** The opposition does not effectively address this reframing. While they argue that advocacy still risks bias, they do not adequately counter the idea that certain forms of advocacy (e.g., based on scientific consensus) can enhance rather than undermine objectivity. The proposition thus presents the stronger case.\n- **Winner:** **Proposition.** The opposition fails to effectively rebut the distinction between evidence-based advocacy and bias, while the proposition provides empirical examples showing how advocacy can enhance public trust in academia.\n\n#### **Clash 2: Inclusivity and Alienation**\n- **Proposition\u2019s Position:** \"Advocacy can coexist with inclusivity when professors model respectful dialogue and encourage diverse perspectives.\"\n- **Opposition\u2019s Position:** \"Professors expressing strong political views can create a chilling effect, marginalizing students and fostering polarization.\"\n- **Analysis:** The opposition provides cited evidence that advocacy by professors can negatively impact classroom discourse. The proposition, however, argues that the presence of advocacy does not inherently suppress opposing opinions and cites institutions where advocacy and open discourse coexist.\n- **Rebuttals:** The proposition directly refutes the opposition\u2019s argument by stating that universities actively foster diverse debate. The opposition fails to provide counterexamples of universities where advocacy has demonstrably harmed open discourse on a systemic level.\n- **Winner:** **Proposition.** The opposition provides evidence that the proposition's argument could be problematic in some instances but does not refute the claim that advocacy and inclusivity can coexist through proper academic moderation.\n\n#### **Clash 3: Expertise and Advocacy**\n- **Proposition\u2019s Position:** \"Professors are not isolated experts; they work across disciplines, ensuring advocacy is informed and balanced.\"\n- **Opposition\u2019s Position:** \"Professors may lack the interdisciplinary expertise necessary for effective advocacy, which can lead to misrepresentation of issues.\"\n- **Analysis:** The opposition argues that advocacy often requires knowledge beyond a single discipline, which could lead to oversimplifications. The proposition responds that interdisciplinary collaboration addresses this concern and provides an example of climate advocacy involving experts from multiple disciplines.\n- **Rebuttals:** The opposition does not refute the argument that interdisciplinary collaboration mitigates the risk of oversimplification. The existence of interdisciplinary research and policy recommendations suggests that professors can responsibly advocate on complex topics.\n- **Winner:** **Proposition.** The opposition's claim about the dangers of limited expertise is not sufficiently defended against the widely accepted practice of interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n### 2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n- The **objectivity vs. advocacy** clash is the most significant because it underlines the primary concern about credibility in academia.\n- The **inclusivity and alienation** clash has a moderate impact as it affects the classroom environment but can be mitigated.\n- The **expertise and advocacy** clash is the least impactful overall because the proposition successfully demonstrates that interdisciplinary collaboration resolves expertise concerns. \n\n### 3. Consistency and Contradictions\n- The opposition maintains internal consistency but fails to address some of the proposition\u2019s key arguments effectively.\n- The proposition remains internally consistent throughout, reinforcing the idea that advocacy and academic integrity are not mutually exclusive.\n\n## II. Evaluation Requirements\n- **Steelmanning:** Each side\u2019s arguments were analyzed in their strongest form.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The decision is based solely on arguments made in the debate.\n- **Ignoring Presentation:** No argument was judged based on rhetorical style.\n- **Framework Neutrality:** Both sides presented valid frameworks, and arguments were evaluated within each.\n\n## III. Common Judging Errors Avoided\n- **No Intervention:** No external arguments were introduced.\n- **Equal Burden of Proof:** Each side needed to prove their assertions.\n- **Avoiding Assumptions:** Causal claims were scrutinized appropriately.\n- **Dropped Arguments Analyzed:** Every argument was addressed in the resolution of clashes.\n\n## IV. Decision Making\n### **Winner: Proposition**\n### **Confidence: 85 (Clear Victory)**\n- **Key Reasons for Decision:**\n  1. The **objectivity clash** was **decisively won by the proposition**, which successfully reframed advocacy as evidence-based rather than ideological.\n  2. The **inclusivity clash** was won by the proposition through a strong counterargument that existing academic structures support diverse debate.\n  3. The **expertise clash** was mitigated by the proposition\u2019s effective argument regarding interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n## V. Line-by-Line Justification\n- **Prop 1:** Introduced strong ethical and practical justifications for professors engaging in public advocacy.\n- **Opp 1:** Provided impactful concerns about objectivity, alienation, and expertise, though some lacked sufficient impact.\n- **Prop Rebuttal:** Successfully reframed central concerns and dismantled opposition arguments about objectivity.\n- **Opp Rebuttal:** Attempted to counter the reframing but did not sufficiently respond to propositional arguments on expertise and inclusivity.\n- **Prop Final:** Effectively summarized the debate, reinforcing the strongest points.\n- **Opp Final:** Restated original arguments but failed to mitigate the proposition\u2019s strongest rebuttals sufficiently.\n\n**Final Judgment: Proposition wins with a confidence level of 85.**\n```xml\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>85</confidence>\n```"

Direct Clash Resolution:\n\nClash 1: Objectivity vs. Advocacy\n- Proposition: \"Professors have a responsibility to leverage their expertise to inform public discourse\"\n- Opposition: \"Professors engaging in public advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions\"\nKey resolution: Proposition wins this clash by successfully reframing objectivity as compatible with evidence-based advocacy, particularly through the COVID-19 example demonstrating how expert advocacy can maintain objectivity while serving public good.\n\nClash 2: Impact on Academic Environment\n- Proposition: \"Active engagement enhances the relevance of academia to real-world issues\"\n- Opposition: \"Public advocacy can alienate students and colleagues who hold differing views\"\nKey resolution: Proposition wins narrowly by providing examples of successful integration at institutions like Harvard and Stanford, though opposition raises valid concerns about classroom dynamics.\n\nClash 3: Expertise and Collaboration\n- Proposition: \"Public advocacy enhances academic landscape through interdisciplinary collaborations\"\n- Opposition: \"Professors may lack expertise or mandate for complex social/political issues\"\nKey resolution: Proposition wins by demonstrating how interdisciplinary collaboration addresses expertise limitations.\n\n2. Argument Hierarchy:\nCore Arguments (in order of importance):\n1. Role of objectivity in academia (foundational)\n2. Impact on academic environment and discourse\n3. Expertise and collaboration requirements\n\n3. Consistency Analysis:\n- No significant internal contradictions found in either side\n- Opposition dropped their rebuttal to proposition's evidence about public health crisis compliance\n- Proposition maintained consistent position throughout while effectively adapting arguments\n\nII. Evaluation Requirements met through thorough analysis of presented arguments without external intervention.\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors avoided by focusing on clash resolution and evidence analysis.\n\nIV. Decision Making:\nThe proposition wins this debate with a confidence level of 75 (Clear Victory).\n\nKey determining factors:\n1. Successfully reframing objectivity as compatible with evidence-based advocacy\n2. Providing concrete examples of successful advocacy integration\n3. Effectively addressing expertise concerns through interdisciplinary collaboration\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\n- Proposition Opening: Established strong foundational case for social responsibility\n- Opposition Opening: Raised valid concerns about objectivity and academic environment\n- Proposition Rebuttal: Successfully defended core principles while addressing opposition concerns\n- Opposition Rebuttal: Made strong points but failed to fully counter proposition's evidence\n- Proposition Closing: Effectively synthesized key arguments and reinforced main points\n- Opposition Closing: Acknowledged strength of proposition's case while maintaining core concerns\n\nThe proposition demonstrated that evidence-based advocacy can coexist with academic objectivity, provided concrete examples of successful implementation, and effectively addressed concerns about expertise through interdisciplinary collaboration. While the opposition raised valid concerns, they ultimately failed to prove these concerns outweighed the benefits of informed advocacy.\n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>75</confidence>"
