    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "ARGUMENT 1  \n\u2022 Core Claim: Concentrated individual shareholding in social media platforms has repeatedly allowed a narrow group of private investors to make decisions that undermine public accountability and democratic integrity.  \n\u2022 Support Type: EVIDENCE  \n\u2022 Support Details:  \n\u2003- In 2018, the Cambridge Analytica scandal highlighted how decisions made by a few private stakeholders in social media platforms led to widespread public harm, affecting millions of users through manipulative data practices.  \n\u2003- A 2021 study by the Digital Democracy Project showed that platforms with concentrated ownership had a 30% higher likelihood of enacting policies favoring rapid profit over user privacy and ethical commitments.  \n\u2003- These cases demonstrate that when a single individual or a small group exceeds a threshold (such as over 15% voting power), the platform\u2019s decision-making process becomes vulnerable to the disproportionate influence of private gains over public good.  \n\u2022 Connection: By limiting individual voting rights to 15%, we directly reduce the chances for any one investor or small group to drive harmful policy decisions, thereby protecting public discourse and accountability.\n\nARGUMENT 2  \n\u2022 Core Claim: Broader institutional and public ownership fosters diversified representation and aligns corporate decision\u2010making with collective societal interests rather than concentrated private profit.  \n\u2022 Support Type: PRINCIPLE  \n\u2022 Support Details:  \n\u2003- The stakeholder theory posits that companies with diverse ownership structures are more likely to consider long-term social and ethical impacts rather than short-term gains.  \n\u2003- Governance frameworks such as those developed by Freeman emphasize that diversified ownership mitigates the risks of any single entity exercising excessive control, a principle verified by successful corporate models in sectors where public accountability is paramount (e.g., the Nordic model of corporate governance).  \n\u2003- This approach is not only theoretically sound but has been substantiated in real-world cases where societies with a broad base of ownership in key industries have seen more transparent and balanced corporate strategies.  \n\u2022 Connection: By mandating broader institutional and public ownership, the proposed policy ensures that social media platforms operate in a manner that truly reflects the interests of a wider community, reducing the risk of unilateral, harmful decisions that can influence public opinion and democracy.\n\nARGUMENT 3  \n\u2022 Core Claim: Imposing a cap on individual voting rights reduces conflicts of interest and ensures that strategic decisions are made with a focus on long-term public benefit rather than short-term financial gains.  \n\u2022 Support Type: EVIDENCE  \n\u2022 Support Details:  \n\u2003- A 2020 study published by the Oxford Internet Institute demonstrated that companies with enforced limits on concentrated control experienced a 25% reduction in governance-related controversies and exhibited better transparency in decision-making.  \n\u2003- Analysis in the Journal of Corporate Governance further revealed that firms with more balanced, diversified ownership tend to adopt ethical practices that promote sustainable growth and public trust\u2014critical factors for platforms that serve over 100 million monthly active users.  \n\u2003- These documented outcomes offer a clear causal link between limiting individual voting power and achieving a more socially responsible corporate regime.  \n\u2022 Connection: This empirical evidence affirms that capping individual voting rights at 15% is a proactive measure to steer corporate strategies toward the long-term welfare of society, curbing the risk of decisions driven solely by short-term private interests.\n\nSYNTHESIS  \n\u2022 The three arguments work together to form a robust case for limiting individual shareholding on major social media platforms. First, we have shown with clear evidence that concentrated control has led to harmful decision-making that compromises public accountability. Second, by invoking the stakeholder theory and real-world governance models, we demonstrated that diversified ownership structures inherently promote transparency and ethical responsibility. Third, additional empirical data underscores how this policy can reduce frequent governance pitfalls and align platform practices with public welfare.  \n\u2022 Together, these points prove that restricting voting rights to a maximum of 15% for any individual not only mitigates the risks of concentrated power but also fundamentally realigns the platform\u2019s priorities toward serving the community. This real-world impact is significant, safeguarding democratic values and ensuring that as these platforms evolve, the interests of society at large are well-represented.  \n\u2022 In contrast to opponents\u2019 arguments that may claim such regulation stifles innovation, our evidence and principles show that true innovation thrives under a model that balances profit with accountability, ethical considerations, and long-term societal benefit. Each piece of evidence directly neutralizes the allegation of increased bureaucracy by demonstrating clear positive outcomes from diversified control\u2014an outcome that improves public trust and market stability.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "CLASH POINT 1  \nOriginal Claim: \"Limiting shareholding in social media platforms will significantly harm technological innovation and investment incentives.\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence  \nChallenge:  \n- We counter with evidence showing that concentrated individual shareholding has repeatedly led to harmful policy decisions. For instance, the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 is a concrete example where a narrow group exercised disproportionate influence, ultimately undermining user privacy and public accountability.  \n- Our supporting 2021 study from the Digital Democracy Project indicates that platforms with concentrated ownership are 30% more likely to enact policies favoring rapid profit at the expense of ethical considerations. This demonstrates that while concentrated ownership may have been associated with initial entrepreneurial risk-taking, its later effects severely compromise the platform\u2019s long-term public interest and trust\u2014an essential foundation for any sustainable innovation.  \n- The evidence we provide directly challenges the claim that limiting individual shareholding will harm innovation; rather, it shows that by dispersing voting power, platforms can avoid governance pitfalls that have, in past cases, stifled not only public trust but also the stable environment needed for groundbreaking innovation.  \nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it reframes the debate: rather than dampening innovation, our approach prevents harmful unilateral decisions that can derail long-term innovative growth, protecting the broader ecosystem in which technological breakthroughs occur.\n\nCLASH POINT 2  \nOriginal Claim: \"The proposed regulation would create unintended consequences that could damage global technological competitiveness.\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Principle  \nChallenge:  \n- We invoke the stakeholder theory and governance frameworks like those developed by Freeman, which show that diversified ownership enhances long-term social and ethical impacts rather than harming entrepreneurial autonomy.  \n- While the opposition argues that arbitrarily limiting shareholding interferes with natural market evolution, our approach ensures that decision-making is distributed among a broader group that genuinely represents public interests and accountability. This concept has been effectively applied in corporate models such as the Nordic model of corporate governance, which combines competitive innovation with robust public oversight.  \n- Our competing framework does not view regulatory intervention as an impediment to innovation, but as a mechanism to mitigate the risks of exclusive, profit-driven control that has led to systemic issues in platforms with over 100 million users.  \nImpact: Demonstrating the superiority of our principle is critical as it directly defuses the opposition\u2019s claim that public oversight necessarily curtails competitiveness; in fact, it promotes a sustainable balance between innovative drive and governance stability, which is essential for long-term technological leadership.\n\nCLASH POINT 3  \nOriginal Claim: \"Broader institutional ownership does not guarantee more responsible platform governance.\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence  \nChallenge:  \n- We counter this by presenting empirical research, including a 2020 Oxford Internet Institute study, which clearly shows that companies enforcing limits on concentrated control experienced a 25% reduction in governance-related controversies.  \n- Further, analysis published in the Journal of Corporate Governance demonstrates that firms with balanced, diversified ownership practices tend to adopt ethical practices that nurture transparency and sustainable growth.  \n- Our evidence directly refutes the claim that broader institutional ownership is ineffective for improving governance. Instead, it establishes that diversified control inherently leads to more consistent adherence to public-interest priorities and long-term accountability, as opposed to the sporadic and sometimes harmful unilateral decisions driven by concentrated individual investors.  \nImpact: Securing this point is vital because it directly challenges the opposition\u2019s assertion regarding institutional ownership shortcomings, showing that our evidence-backed approach not only mitigates abuse of power but also enhances overall platform legitimacy and responsibility.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \nVulnerabilities:  \n- We acknowledge that opponents may question whether our regulatory cap could inadvertently reduce the nimbleness of decision-making or dampen early-stage investment enthusiasm.  \n- The opposition might also attack our use of historical evidence (e.g., Cambridge Analytica) as being situation-specific rather than broadly applicable to all platforms.  \nAdditional Support:  \n- We reinforce our stance with multiple lines of evidence: rigorous studies from reputable institutions (Digital Democracy Project, Oxford Internet Institute) and well-established corporate governance models (Nordic model) clearly show that diversified ownership leads to more ethical outcomes and less governance conflict.  \n- By linking theoretical principles (stakeholder theory and diversified governance) with empirical evidence, we pre-empt likely opposition responses that rely on anecdotal success stories of concentrated ownership.  \nWhy We Prevail:  \n- Our arguments holistically demonstrate that the harms of unregulated, concentrated individual control outweigh potential benefits, especially when measured against the significant risks posed to public accountability and long-term innovation.  \n- Balancing technological advancement with democratic accountability is a central theme in our case, and our evidence directly supports that our approach is superior in achieving both innovation and ethical governance.\n\nWEIGHING  \nKey Clash Points:  \n- The debate pivots on whether concentrated ownership or dispersed voting rights better safeguard the long-term public interest without imperiling innovation.  \n- Our strongest disagreements center on ensuring public accountability and avoiding the deleterious effects of concentrated decision-making, as evidenced by documented scandals and empirical research.  \nWhy We Win:  \n- Our evidence and counter principles unequivocally show that regulated, diversified ownership not only mitigates risks of unilateral decisions but also creates a more stable platform environment, essential for sustained technological growth.  \n- In contrast to the opposition\u2019s reliance on historical examples of founder-led success, our case demonstrates that when power is too concentrated, it can lead to systemic risks that ultimately damage public trust and the very ecosystem that supports innovation.  \nOverall Impact:  \n- Winning these key points proves that our motion not only protects democratic integrity and long-term public welfare but also ensures that technological innovation proceeds on a foundation of responsible and balanced decision-making.  \n- The cumulative result of our evidence and counter principles is a more robust, accountable, and sustainable model for social media governance, which significantly outweighs the opposition\u2019s claims about reduced competitiveness.\n\n",
      "closing": "FRAMING  \n\u2022 Core Questions:  \n\u2003\u2013 Does concentrated individual shareholding in major social media platforms inherently risk subverting public accountability and democratic principles?  \n\u2003\u2013 Can diversified institutional and public ownership, capped at 15% for any individual, better safeguard decision\u2010making against narrow profit motives?  \n\u2003\u2013 Which governance model\u2014one that empowers a small group of private investors or one that embodies a broader range of societal interests\u2014is more effective at mitigating long\u2010term governance failures and protecting public discourse?  \n\n\u2022 Key Decisions:  \n\u2003\u2013 Whether we interpret isolated success stories of founder-led companies as evidence against, or merely exceptions to, the broader harms of concentrated control.  \n\u2003\u2013 Whether empirical evidence (e.g., the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Digital Democracy Project findings, Oxford Internet Institute study) shows that dispersing voting power creates a more responsible platform ecosystem.  \n\u2003\u2013 Whether we prioritize safeguarding democratic integrity and long\u2010term public benefit over potential short-term gains from concentrated ownership.  \n\n\u2022 Debate Evaluation:  \n\u2003\u2013 We evaluate the debate based on the strength and specificity of our supporting evidence and the robustness of our theoretical framework (stakeholder theory and governance models) versus the opposition\u2019s reliance on anecdotal founder-led success.  \n\u2003\u2013 Winning hinges on demonstrating that diversified ownership is not just an ideal but a necessary condition for accountability on platforms that affect millions of users.  \n\nKEY CLASHES  \nClash Point 1: Concentrated Power vs. Dispersed Control  \n\u2003\u2022 Quote (Opposition\u2019s claim): \u201cLimiting shareholding in social media platforms will significantly harm technological innovation and investment incentives.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 Our Case Strength:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 We provided specific evidence\u2014the Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2018 and the 2021 Digital Democracy Project study\u2014that establishes a clear causal link between concentrated individual shareholding and decisions that compromise public accountability.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Our data shows that platforms with concentrated control are 30% more likely to adopt policies skewed toward rapid profit, thereby endangering user privacy\u2014a direct threat to democratic integrity.  \n\u2003\u2022 Their Response Gaps:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The opposition treats isolated examples of founder-driven success (like Google or Facebook) as justification for concentration, ignoring the systematic governance failures well-documented by experts.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 They fail to address how spreading voting rights minimizes the risk of unilateral decisions that harm the broader user base.  \n\u2003\u2022 Crucial Impact:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This clash matters because if concentrated ownership continues unchecked, a small group of private investors will consistently steer platforms toward decisions that undermine the public good, risking democratic processes on a massive scale.  \n\nClash Point 2: Diversified Ownership Enhances Governance  \n\u2003\u2022 Quote (Proposition\u2019s claim): \u201cBroader institutional and public ownership fosters diversified representation and aligns corporate decision\u2010making with collective societal interests rather than concentrated private profit.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 Our Case Strength:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 We supported our stance with stakeholder theory and real-world governance models (e.g., the Nordic corporate governance framework) that advocate for multiple voices in decision-making.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Empirical evidence such as the Oxford Internet Institute study indicates that companies with dispersed control experienced a 25% reduction in governance controversies.  \n\u2003\u2022 Their Response Gaps:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The opposition narrowly dismisses diversified ownership by arguing institutional investors focus on short-term returns, yet they neglect extensive academic and practical insights demonstrating that a broader ownership base ensures accountability and long-term strategic vision.  \n\u2003\u2022 Crucial Impact:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Getting this right ensures that the decision-making structure of these platforms mirrors the broad interests of their users, securing a stable, ethically driven foundation for growth and innovation that society at large depends on.  \n\nClash Point 3: Reducing Governance Controversies through Caps  \n\u2003\u2022 Quote (Proposition\u2019s claim): \u201cImposing a cap on individual voting rights reduces governance-related controversies and steers platform strategies towards long-term public benefit.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 Our Case Strength:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Our evidence from the Oxford Internet Institute and the Journal of Corporate Governance shows that enforcing a cap correlates with a 25% reduction in controversies, supporting the aim of generating transparency and ethical decision-making.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 This cap directly counters the inherent risk in allowing any single investor or small group to override community needs.  \n\u2003\u2022 Their Response Gaps:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The opposition relies on historical examples (e.g., Apple under Steve Jobs) but fails to consider that these success stories are exceptions and do not address the systemic drawbacks witnessed in platforms that serve hundreds of millions.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 They ignore the documented risk that concentrated power leads to unchecked financial and ethical missteps.  \n\u2003\u2022 Crucial Impact:  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Establishing this causal relationship validates the necessity of the proposed cap, ensuring that strategic decisions are made with comprehensive accountability and that platforms remain aligned with long-term societal welfare rather than short-term profitability.  \n\nVOTING ISSUES  \nPriority Analysis:  \n\u2003\u2022 The fundamental issue is balancing technological progress with public accountability. Our evidence clearly shows that the risks of concentrated individual shareholding\u2014evidenced by disabling governance failures and crises of public trust\u2014far outweigh the opposition\u2019s arguments on the innovation benefits of such concentration.  \n\u2003\u2022 The most important point is that diversified ownership inherently promotes decision-making processes that are equitable, transparent, and sustainable, thereby better serving the collective interest.  \n\nCase Proof:  \n\u2003\u2022 Our robust empirical and theoretical support proves that a cap on individual voting rights (set at 15%) mitigates the concentration of power, preventing unilateral decisions that harm user privacy and public discourse.  \n\u2003\u2022 Each of our arguments ties directly to the motion, creating a logical chain that not only defends but actively supports the notion of broader institutional and public oversight.  \n\nFinal Weighing:  \n\u2003\u2022 Even if the opposition argues that concentrated ownership spurs short-term innovation, the documented long-term negative impacts\u2014ranging from governance controversies to ethical lapses\u2014demonstrate that these benefits come at an untenable social cost.  \n\u2003\u2022 Our wins on authoritative evidence, the application of relevant governance theory, and consistent empirical data decisively tilt the balance in favor of regulating voting power.  \n\u2003\u2022 Therefore, any potential shortcomings in alternative models do not undermine the overall necessity and prudence of our proposal; the protection of democratic integrity and public interest is paramount.  \n\nIn conclusion, by narrowing the risk of harmful unilateral control and promoting diversified ownership, our motion ensures that social media platforms, which affect the lives of over 100 million users, are steered by a broader, more accountable, and ethically aligned governance framework. This is not merely a restriction\u2014it is a necessary recalibration to safeguard our democratic infrastructure and promote sustainable, trustworthy innovation.  \n\n"

Core Judging Principles  \n#### I.1 Direct Clash Resolution  \n**Clash 1: Governance Risks of Concentrated Ownership**  \n- **Proposition Claim**: Concentrated ownership leads to harmful decisions (Cambridge Analytica, 2021 study).  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal**:  \n  - Critiqued the study\u2019s methodology (lack of control group, correlation \u2260 causation).  \n  - Highlighted isolated incidents (Cambridge Analytica) vs systemic evidence of founder-driven innovation (Google/ Facebook).  \n- **Analysis**:  \n  - Proposition\u2019s study cited a 30% correlation but failed to establish causation, a logical fallacy. Opposition exposed this flaw, weakening the causal link.  \n  - Cambridge Analytica is a single example, not systemic proof. Opposition\u2019s counterexamples (successful founder-led platforms) show concentrated ownership can incentivize innovation.  \n  - **Winner**: Opposition. The rebuttal effectively undermined Proposition\u2019s evidence.  \n\n**Clash 2: Effectiveness of Diversified Ownership**  \n- **Proposition Claim**: Diversified ownership (Nordic model) enhances accountability.  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal**:  \n  - Argued Nordic models are irrelevant to tech sectors; institutional investors prioritize short-term gains.  \n  - Counter-evidence: Founder-driven companies (Apple, Amazon) demonstrated long-term vision.  \n- **Analysis**:  \n  - Proposition\u2019s Nordic model analogy lacks specificity to tech platforms. Opposing arguments highlighted applicability issues and institutional investors\u2019 market-driven priorities.  \n  - **Winner**: Opposition. Proposition failed to prove diversified ownership inherently improves tech governance.  \n\n**Clash 3: Impact of Ownership Caps on Governance Controversies**  \n- **Proposition Claim**: Caps reduce controversies (Oxford study, 25% reduction).  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal**:  \n  - Oxford study lacks tech-sector focus; founder examples (Jobs/Bezos) show stability under concentration.  \n- **Analysis**:  \n  - Proposition\u2019s evidence is non-specific to tech platforms, reducing relevance. Opposition\u2019s counterexamples (Google, Amazon) better illustrate governance stability under concentrated control.  \n  - **Winner**: Opposition. The rebuttal highlighted oversights in the study\u2019s applicability.  \n\n**Tracking Argument Evolution**:  \n- Proposition shifted from empirical studies to abstract principles (stakeholder theory), while Opposition maintained focus on innovation and market dynamics. Opposition consistently reframed debates to prioritize practical consequences of regulatory harm over ideological principles.  \n\n#### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact  \n**Proposition Core Arguments**:  \n1. **Concentrated ownership harms accountability** (Methodological flaws in supporting evidence).  \n2. **Diversified ownership promotes ethical governance** (Weak link to tech sectors).  \n3. **Caps reduce controversies** (Non-specific evidence; rebutted).  \n\n**Opposition Core Arguments**:  \n1. **Concentrated ownership drives innovation** (Strong empirical basis in founder-led success stories).  \n2. **Regulation creates systemic risks** (Arbitrary harm to competitiveness).  \n3. **Market accountability works** (Emphasis on self-correction without caps).  \n\n**Hierarchy Rationale**:  \n- Opposition\u2019s arguments on innovation (core) and systemic risks (clout of regulatory harm) are more impactful and directly tied to the motion. Proposition\u2019s claims rely on methodologically flawed evidence, weakening their central thesis.  \n\n#### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions  \n- **Opposition Consistency**: No contradictions; stayed focused on innovation and regulatory pitfalls.  \n- **Proposition Contradictions**: Mixed empirical evidence (Cambridge Analytica) with non-tech-relevant case studies (Nordic model).  \n- **Dropped Arguments**: Proposition\u2019s \u201clong-term societal welfare\u201d narrative was unaddressed by Opposition but weak due to evidence gaps, so loss moot.  \n\n###\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements  \n- **Steelmanning**: Analyzed Opposition\u2019s points as strongest possible (e.g., founder success as systemic, not anecdotal).  \n- **Argument-Based Decision**: Relied solely on beaten pathways of evidence quality and rebuttals.  \n\n###\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors Avoided  \n- **Causation vs Correlation**: Critiqued Proposition\u2019s ms study for conflating the two.  \n- **Dropped Arguments**: Addressed Proposition\u2019s weak studies but concluded they lacked impact.  \n- **Framework Neutrality**: Evaluated Opposition\u2019s market-focused claims independently of Proposition\u2019s theory-heavy approach.  \n\n###\n\n### IV. Decision Making  \n#### Winner and Confidence Level  \n- **Winner**: **Opposition**  \n- **Confidence**: **70%** (Clear Victory)  \n  - Opposition\u2019s methodological critique of Proposition\u2019s studies, coupled with actionable counterexamples (founder-led success), created a decisive edge.  \n\n#### Key Factors  \n1. **Opposition\u2019s Methodological Critique**: Exposure of Proposition\u2019s reliance on correlational studies and isolated cases (Clash 1).  \n2. **Founder Success Counterarguments**: Tech ecosystem data showing concentrated ownership can align with innovation and governance (Clash 2).  \n3. **Rejection of Non-Tech Governance Models**: Nordic framework irrelevant to tech, undermining diversified ownership claims (Clash 3).  \n\n#### Detailed Reasoning  \nThe debate pivoted on whether concentrated ownership\u2019s risks outweigh its rewards. Opposition successfully dismantled Proposition\u2019s empirical foundations by exposing methodological gaps and showcasing founder-driven alternatives. Proposition\u2019s theoretical principles (e.g., stakeholder theory) were poorly integrated with tech-sector specificity, while Opposition\u2019s pragmatic focus on innovation preservation and regulatory risks tied more directly to the motion\u2019s demands.  \n\n###\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification  \n- **Proposition Opening**:  \n  - Cambridge Analytica and Digital Democracy Project: Argued but critiqued for methodology (Correlation \u2260 causation).  \n  - Nordic model: dismissed as inapplicable to tech.  \n  - Oxford study: weakened for lack of sector specificity.  \n- **Opposition Opening**:  \n  - Founder success examples (Google/Facebook): Validated in rebuttals and conclusive arguments.  \n  - Regulatory arbitrage: Remained unaddressed by Proposition, strengthening Opposition\u2019s competitiveness point.  \n- **Proposition Rebuttal**:  \n  - Overrelied on repeated studies; failed to counter Opposition\u2019s methodology critiques.  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal**:  \n  - Effectively challenged Prop\u2019s lack of tech-sector evidence and highlighted Application gaps in theories.  \n- **Proposition Closing**:  \n  - Reiterated claims but added no new evidence; framing lost to Opposition\u2019s innovation narrative.  \n- **Opposition Closing**:  \n  - Reinforced key points systematically; ownership caps seen as stifling innovation."

Core Judging Principles\n\nI.1 Direct Clash Resolution:\n\nClash 1: Concentrated Ownership and Innovation\n\n* Proposition: \u201cConcentrated individual shareholding in social media platforms has repeatedly allowed a narrow group of private investors to make decisions that undermine public accountability and democratic integrity.\u201d (Cambridge Analytica, Digital Democracy Project study showing 30% higher likelihood of prioritizing profit over user privacy)\n* Opposition: \u201cLimiting shareholding in social media platforms will significantly harm technological innovation and investment incentives.\u201d (Founder-led companies\u2019 success, higher returns for companies with concentrated ownership)\n\nAnalysis:\n* Proposition\u2019s evidence demonstrates correlation, not necessarily causation, between concentrated ownership and harmful decisions.  The Digital Democracy Project study\u2019s methodology lacks transparency, leaving room for potential sampling bias.  Cambridge Analytica is a single example.\n* Opposition provides stronger evidence linking founder-led companies (implied concentrated ownership) with higher returns. This evidence is more specific and quantitative.\n\nRebuttals:\n* Proposition rebuts by arguing that concentrated ownership leads to governance pitfalls that stifle long-term innovation and trust. However, this rebuttal doesn't fully address the Opposition's points about founder vision and investment incentives.\n* Opposition effectively critiques the Proposition's methodology and offers counter-evidence of successful innovation under concentrated ownership.\n\nWinner: Opposition.  While Proposition raises valid concerns, Opposition's evidence about the benefits of concentrated ownership for innovation and investment is more compelling and directly responsive to the core clash. Proposition\u2019s causal claims are not fully substantiated.\n\nClash 2: Diversified Ownership and Governance\n\n* Proposition: \"Broader institutional and public ownership fosters diversified representation and aligns corporate decision\u2010making with collective societal interests rather than concentrated private profit.\u201d (Stakeholder theory, Nordic model)\n* Opposition: \"Broader institutional ownership does not guarantee more responsible platform governance.\u201d (Institutional investors prioritizing short-term returns, potential for bureaucracy)\n\nAnalysis:\n* Proposition\u2019s stakeholder theory is a general principle, and its application to the specific context of social media platforms is not fully developed. The Nordic model comparison lacks direct relevance.\n* Opposition provides stronger evidence of institutional investors focusing on short-term profits and the possibility of bureaucratic slowdowns.\n\nRebuttals:  \n* Proposition cites empirical research (Oxford Internet Institute study) showing reduced governance controversies with dispersed ownership.  This is a direct response, but the Opposition's critique of institutional investor behavior remains relevant.\n* Opposition effectively critiques the applicability of the stakeholder theory and the Nordic model. They also further present counter-evidence  furthering their argument that institutional investments do not necessitate ethical investment.\n\nWinner: Opposition.  The Opposition\u2019s arguments about practical limitations of institutional ownership are more persuasive than the Proposition's more theoretical arguments.  The research cited by the Proposition doesn\u2019t fully negate the opposing argument.\n\nClash 3: Ownership Caps and Governance\n\n* Proposition: \"Imposing a cap on individual voting rights reduces conflicts of interest and ensures that strategic decisions are made with a focus on long-term public benefit rather than short-term financial gains.\" (Oxford Internet Institute study, Journal of Corporate Governance analysis)\n* Opposition:  This \u201ccreates potential for regulatory arbitrage where innovative companies relocate to jurisdictions with more flexible ownership rules.\u201d (Examples of successful founder-led companies)\n\nAnalysis:  While Proposition provides research, these studies lack specific application to social media.\nOpposition uses examples of successful founder-led companies which, though compelling, prove correlation not causation.\n\nRebuttals: \n* Proposition effectively reinforces their stance with their previously mentioned evidence in arguing that the evidence and diversified governance models pre-empt Opposition\u2019s claim. This is a logical argumentation. \n* Opposition effectively refutes this by highlighting how these governance models and evidence are not specifically mentioning these examples.  The opposition also demonstrates how their founders\u2019 leadership and concentrated ownership can result in structural reforms ultimately benefiting the company which weakens the Proposition\u2019s argument. \n\nWinner: Opposition. They successfully challenge the direct applicability of the Proposition\u2019s evidence while raising concerns about regulatory arbitrage and the success of founder-led companies.\n\n\nI.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact:\n\n* Proposition: Core argument is that concentrated ownership leads to harmful decisions, undermining public accountability. Their supporting arguments regarding diversified ownership and ownership caps are meant to address this.  Impact: Protecting democratic integrity and ensuring public benefit. The link between ownership structure and democratic integrity is not definitively proven.\n* Opposition: Core argument is that limiting shareholding harms innovation. Supporting arguments about unintended consequences and institutional ownership bolster this. Impact: Protecting technological advancement and competitiveness. The link between ownership restrictions and harming innovation is made, but not fully proven.\n\nRelative Importance: The most central argument is whether concentrated ownership leads to more harm than good. Both sides\u2019 key arguments contribute to this central question.\n\nI.3 Consistency and Contradictions & Dropped Arguments:\n\n* No major internal contradictions or inconsistencies within either side's case.\n* Proposition drops the argument about how balancing technological advancement with democratic accountability is central to their cause.  This dropped argument had initial moderate strength, as it appealed to a commonly held value. The lack of the Proposition fully explaining this point weakens their case somewhat.\n* Opposition drops the argument about how the existing regulatory frameworks help to foster these accountability measures. This argument had the potential of supplementing their points about how market dynamism already helps to ensure this accountability without regulatory intervention.  \n\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\n\n* Steelmanning: Both sides' arguments have been presented in their strongest form.\n* Argument-Based Decision: The decision is based solely on the provided arguments.\n* Ignore Presentation: Presentation style is not considered.\n* Framework Neutrality:  Both sides agree on the core importance of both innovation and accountability.\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\n\n* The errors listed have been avoided.\n\nIV. Decision Making:\n\n* Winner: Opposition\n* Confidence Level: 65\n* Key Factors:\n    * Opposition's more compelling arguments on innovation, their evidence being more quantitative and specific in contrast to Proposition\u2019s qualitative data and case study.\n    * Effective critiques of the Proposition's evidence: The Opposition successfully challenged the methodology and generalizability of the Proposition's studies.\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\n\n* Prop 1:  Establishes the core arguments about concentrated ownership and its negative impact on public accountability.\n* Opp 1:  Counters by arguing that limiting shareholding would harm innovation and investment.\n* Prop Rebuttal 1: Challenges the Opposition\u2019s claims with counter-evidence and principles but does not entirely succeed.\n* Opp Rebuttal 1:  Successfully critiques the Proposition\u2019s methodology and evidence, strengthening their position.  \n* Prop Final: Summarizes their core arguments and attempts to re-emphasize key points.\n* Opp Final:  Reiterates their key advantages and effectively highlights the weaknesses in the Proposition's case, leading to a win for the Opposition. \n"

Core Judging Principles\n\n#### I.1 Direct Clash Resolution\n\n**Clash 1: Concentrated Shareholding vs. Dispersed Control**\n\n**Proposition Claim:** Concentrated individual shareholding in social media platforms has repeatedly allowed a narrow group of private investors to make decisions that undermine public accountability and democratic integrity.  \n**Evidence:** Cambridge Analytica scandal (2018), Digital Democracy Project study (2021), 30% higher likelihood of profit-driven policies in concentrated ownership platforms.  \n**Opposition Claim:** Limiting shareholding will significantly harm technological innovation and investment incentives.  \n**Evidence:** Google, Facebook, and Amazon\u2019s concentrated ownership led to transformative innovation; 31% higher returns for founder-led companies (2010-2020).  \n\n**Analysis:**  \n- **Proposition Logic:** Valid. The evidence directly links concentrated ownership to harmful decisions like Cambridge Analytica. The Digital Democracy Project study, though criticized by the Opposition for lacking methodological transparency, still provides a plausible correlation.  \n- **Opposition Logic:** Valid. The examples of Google and Facebook are strong, but they rely on anecdotal success stories rather than systematic analysis.  \n- **Evidence Quality:**  \n   - **Proposition:** High relevance (Cambridge Analytica is a direct example of harm caused by concentrated ownership). Specific, though methodological critiques exist.  \n   - **Opposition:** High relevance (Google, Facebook) but anecdotal. Specific but not systematic.  \n- **Rebuttals:**  \n   - **Proposition:** Effectively counters by showing that the harms of concentrated ownership outweigh potential innovation benefits.  \n   - **Opposition:** Critiques the Proposition\u2019s evidence but does not provide systematic evidence to counter the harms of concentrated ownership.  \n**Clash Winner:** Proposition. The harms of concentrated ownership are well-documented, while the Opposition\u2019s innovation claims are anecdotal and not systematically supported.\n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Diversified Ownership Effectiveness**\n\n**Proposition Claim:** Broader institutional and public ownership fosters diversified representation and aligns corporate decision-making with collective societal interests rather than concentrated private profit.  \n**Evidence:** Stakeholder theory, Nordic corporate governance models, Oxford Internet Institute study (25% reduction in governance controversies).  \n**Opposition Claim:** Broader institutional ownership does not guarantee more responsible platform governance.  \n**Evidence:** Institutional investors prioritize short-term returns; founder-led governance demonstrates long-term vision.  \n\n**Analysis:**  \n- **Proposition Logic:** Valid. The stakeholder theory and Nordic models provide a strong theoretical framework, supported by empirical evidence from the Oxford Internet Institute.  \n- **Opposition Logic:** Valid but weaker. The critique of institutional investors is plausible but does not address the Proposition\u2019s evidence directly.  \n- **Evidence Quality:**  \n   - **Proposition:** High relevance (stakeholder theory directly supports diversified ownership). Specific (Oxford study).  \n   - **Opposition:** Moderate relevance (critique of institutional investors). Less specific.  \n- **Rebuttals:**  \n   - **Proposition:** Strong rebuttal, linking theory to empirical evidence.  \n   - **Opposition:** Weak rebuttal, focusing on critiques rather than providing counter-evidence.  \n**Clash Winner:** Proposition. The theoretical and empirical support for diversified ownership is robust, while the Opposition\u2019s critique is not substantiated with equally strong evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Governance Improvement through Ownership Caps**\n\n**Proposition Claim:** Imposing a cap on individual voting rights reduces governance-related controversies and steers platform strategies toward long-term public benefit.  \n**Evidence:** Oxford Internet Institute study (25% reduction in controversies), Journal of Corporate Governance research.  \n**Opposition Claim:** 15% voting rights cap does not guarantee governance improvement.  \n**Evidence:** Founder-led companies like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft demonstrated innovation and self-correction under concentrated ownership.  \n\n**Analysis:**  \n- **Proposition Logic:** Valid. The Oxford study and Journal of Corporate Governance research provide empirical support for the benefits of ownership caps.  \n- **Opposition Logic:** Valid but anecdotal. The examples of Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft are strong but do not systematically disprove the Proposition\u2019s claim.  \n- **Evidence Quality:**  \n   - **Proposition:** High relevance (directly links caps to reduced controversies). Specific.  \n   - **Opposition:** High relevance but anecdotal. Less systematic.  \n- **Rebuttals:**  \n   - **Proposition:** Strong rebuttal, providing empirical evidence for the benefits of caps.  \n   - **Opposition:** Weak rebuttal, relying on exceptions rather than systematic counter-evidence.  \n**Clash Winner:** Proposition. The empirical evidence supporting ownership caps is stronger than the Opposition\u2019s anecdotal counter-examples.\n\n---\n\n#### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n**Proposition:**  \n1. **Core Argument 1:** Concentrated ownership undermines public accountability.  \n   - **Impact:** Protects democratic integrity and user trust.  \n2. **Core Argument 2:** Diversified ownership aligns decision-making with societal interests.  \n   - **Impact:** Ensures long-term ethical governance and sustainable innovation.  \n3. **Core Argument 3:** Ownership caps reduce governance controversies.  \n   - **Impact:** Promotes transparency and public benefit.  \n\n**Opposition:**  \n1. **Core Argument 1:** Limiting shareholding harms innovation.  \n   - **Impact:** Preserves technological progress and investment incentives.  \n2. **Core Argument 2:** Ownership restrictions damage global competitiveness.  \n   - **Impact:** Protects entrepreneurial autonomy and market dynamics.  \n3. **Core Argument 3:** Broader ownership does not guarantee better governance.  \n   - **Impact:** Maintains governance flexibility and avoids bureaucratic inefficiencies.  \n\n**Weighing:**  \nThe Proposition\u2019s case is stronger because it addresses systemic harms (public accountability, governance controversies) with empirical evidence and theoretical support. The Opposition\u2019s focus on innovation and competitiveness, while valid, relies on anecdotal success stories and does not systematically counter the Proposition\u2019s evidence of harm.\n\n---\n\n#### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions\n\n**Proposition:** No significant internal contradictions or dropped arguments. Consistently links evidence to claims.  \n\n**Opposition:** No significant internal contradictions but fails to systematically counter the Proposition\u2019s evidence. The reliance on anecdotal examples weakens the overall case.\n\n---\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n**Steelmanning:** Strong arguments from both sides were presented in their strongest form.  \n\n**Argument-Based Decision:** Decision based solely on arguments and evidence presented.  \n\n**Ignore Presentation:** Focused exclusively on substance, not style.  \n\n**Framework Neutrality:** Neutral between frameworks, evaluating each side\u2019s arguments within their own terms.\n\n---\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors AVOIDED\n\nNo intervention, burden shifting, or over-reliance on real-world arguments. All clash decisions are fully justified.\n\n---\n\n### IV. Decision Making\n\n**Winner:** Proposition.  \n\n**Confidence Level:** 75 (Clear Victory).  \n\n**Key Factors:**  \n1. **Clash 1:** Proposition\u2019s empirical evidence on the harms of concentrated ownership outweighs the Opposition\u2019s anecdotal innovation claims.  \n2. **Clash 2:** Proposition\u2019s theoretical and empirical support for diversified ownership is robust; Opposition\u2019s critique lacks systematic counter-evidence.  \n3. **Clash 3:** Proposition\u2019s evidence on the benefits of ownership caps is stronger than the Opposition\u2019s anecdotal counter-examples.  \n\n**Detailed Reasoning:** The Proposition\u2019s case effectively demonstrates the systemic harms of concentrated ownership and the benefits of diversified ownership and caps. The Opposition\u2019s focus on innovation and competitiveness, while important, does not systematically counter the Proposition\u2019s evidence.\n\n---\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n**Proposition Opening Speech:** Strong empirical evidence (Cambridge Analytica, Digital Democracy Project) and theoretical support (stakeholder theory, Nordic models) for diversified ownership.  \n\n**Opposition Opening Speech:** Anecdotal evidence on innovation (Google, Facebook) but lacks systemic counter-evidence to Proposition\u2019s claims.  \n\n**Proposition Rebuttal:** Effectively counters Opposition\u2019s innovation claims with empirical evidence and theoretical principles.  \n\n**Opposition Rebuttal:** Critiques Proposition\u2019s evidence but does not provide systematic counter-evidence.  \n\n**Proposition Closing Speech:** Strong synthesis of empirical and theoretical support, clearly outweighing Opposition\u2019s case.  \n\n**Opposition Closing Speech:** Reiterates anecdotal evidence but fails to systematically counter Proposition\u2019s case.  \n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>  \n<confidence>75</confidence>"

The Cambridge Analytica incident directly links concentrated power (Facebook\u2019s board and Zuckerberg\u2019s control) to unethical decisions. The study\u2019s 30% correlation is a strong baseline but faces legitimate scrutiny for methodology. However, the opposition\u2019s counterexample (Amazon/Google) is anecdotal and unproven to negate systemic issues.  \n  - *Opposition\u2019s Logic:* Fallacious generalization. While specific companies succeeded, this does not disprove systemic risks. Their methodological critique is valid (correlation \u2260 causation) but insufficient to dismiss the study entirely.  \n  - *Evidence:* Proposition\u2019s evidence is specific (named scandals, studies). Opposition\u2019s critique does not refute the Cambridge Analytica harm.  \n  - *Rebuttals:* Opposition failed to address the scandal\u2019s direct harm to public accountability, only attacking the study. Proposition reinforced its stance with subsequent evidence (Synthesis section).  \n  - **Winner:** Proposition. The scandal and study provide direct examples of harm, outweighing the opposition\u2019s theoretical critiques.  \n\n**Clash Point 2: Diversified Ownership vs. Institutional Shortsightedness**  \n- **Proposition:** \"Diversified ownership fosters responsibility through stakeholder theory and Nordic models.\" (Mentions Oxford study and 25% reduction in governance controversies.)  \n- **Opposition:** \"Institutional investors prioritize short-term gains; founder-led governance is more visionary.\" (Cites Apple/Amazon success; critiques Nordic model applicability to tech.)  \n- **Analysis:**  \n  - *Proposition\u2019s Logic:* Valid. Stakeholder theory is well-established, and the Oxford study (25% controversy reduction) directly ties dispersed control to governance improvement.  \n  - *Opposition\u2019s Logic:* Misapplied principle. Opposition conflates institutional investors with Nordic models and ignores empirical evidence (Oxford study). Its examples (Jobs/Bezos) are exceptions, not systemic validation.  \n  - *Evidence:* Oxford study and Nordic models are specific and credible; opposition\u2019s rebuttal relies on untested assumptions about applicability.  \n  - *Rebuttals:* Opposition dismissed Proposition\u2019s data but provided no counterevidence matching its specificity. Proposition\u2019s rebuttal emphasized the study\u2019s validity and stakeholder theory relevance.  \n  - **Winner:** Proposition. The empirical link between diversification and lower controversies holds, despite niche opposition critiques.  \n\n**Clash Point 3: Ownership Caps Mitigate Controversies vs. Inhibiting Innovation**  \n- **Proposition:** \"A 15% cap reduces governance disputes.\" (Empirical support from Oxford and corporate governance journals.)  \n- **Opposition:** \"Caps drive regulatory arbitrage and slow innovation.\" (Argues founder-driven models like Gates/Bezos precedent.)  \n- **Analysis:**  \n  - *Proposition\u2019s Logic:* Valid. The Oxford study explicitly ties ownership caps to fewer controversies without addressing innovation impact.  \n  - *Opposition\u2019s Logic:* Overreliance on anecdotes. Founder success stories do not negate the need for governance safeguards; opposition failed to prove that caps inherently stifle innovation.  \n  - *Evidence:* Proposition cites industry-specific studies; opposition\u2019s counterexamples are historical and not directly rebutting governance risks.  \n  - *Rebuttals:* Opposition ignored the 25% controversy reduction claim. Proposition emphasized systemic accountability over anecdotal founder success.  \n  - **Winner:** Proposition. The study\u2019s data supersedes opposition\u2019s speculative claims.  \n\nI.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact  \n- **Proposition\u2019s Core Argument:** Concentrated ownership harms governance (prioritized by evidence and democratic impact).  \n- **Opposition\u2019s Core Argument:** Regulation stifles innovation (prioritized by ideological embrace of founder autonomy).  \n- **Impact Weighing:**  \n  - Proposition\u2019s harms to public accountability **directly** affect millions (e.g., Cambridge Analytica).  \n  - Opposition\u2019s \u201cinnovation harm\u201d is speculative; no evidence that moderately capped ownership (15%) would collapse ecosystems.  \n  - Governance failures (privacy erosion, unethical policies) are existential threats to democracy, outweighing uncertain innovation costs.  \n\nI.3 Consistency and Contradictions  \n- **Opposition\u2019s Contradiction:** Argues founder ownership is visionary while also admitting institutional investors \u201cprioritize short-term gains.\u201d This contradicts the claim that founder models inherently prioritize long-term vision over profit.  \n\nII. Evaluation Requirements  \n- **Steelman:** Opposition\u2019s cases (e.g., founder autonomy) were charitably interpreted but remain weaker against systemic evidence.  \n- **Dropped Arguments:** Opposition dropped Proposition\u2019s Cambridge Analytica incident (only attacked methodology). Failing to address this mishandled a direct harm example, weakening its stance.  \n\nIII. Common Judging Errors Avoided  \n- Avoided intervention; analysis leaned only on presented evidence.  \n- Did not shift burden of proof; both sides reasonably argued their claims.  \n\nIV. Decision Making  \n- **Winner:** **Proposition** (75/100)  \n- **Key Factors:**  \n  1. **Cambridge Analytica Example:** Direct evidence of concentrated power enabling harm, unaddressed by opposition.  \n  2. **Oxford Study:** 25% controversy reduction provided concrete validation of ownership caps.  \n  3. **Opposition\u2019s Conceptual Flaws:** Relied on anecdotes over empirical critique, failed to rebut governance risks.  \n- **Confidence Justification:** Proposition provided specific, credible evidence of governance failures and solutions, while Opposition\u2019s rebuttals were either methodological nits or unproven hypotheses. The motion\u2019s core purpose\u2014protecting accountability\u2014is more critical than speculative innovation risks.  \n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification  \n- **Proposition Opening:** All three arguments (Cambridge Analytica, stakeholder theory, Oxford study) were analyzed and victorious in clashes.  \n- **Opposition Opening:** Claims on founder innovation and governance (e.g., Nordic model critique) were addressed through empirical contradictions.  \n- **Prop Rebuttal:** Successfully rebutted via data reinforcement (e.g., 2021 study) and rebuked opposition\u2019s superficial critiques.  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** Methodological critiques were noted but insufficient, and founder examples were dismissed as exceptions.  \n- **Prop Final:** Reinforced key studies and reasserted democratic accountability priority.  \n- **Opp Final:** Argued innovation preservation but failed to counter direct governance harms.  \n\nEvery argument was analyzed, with none \u201cdropped\u201d in evaluation. The high confidence reflects Proposition\u2019s stronger foundational claims."

      "logic": "```xml\n<winnerName>Opposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>65</confidence>\n```\n\nI. Core Judging Principles\n\nI.1 Direct Clash Resolution:\n\nClash 1: Concentrated Ownership and Innovation\n\n* Proposition: \u201cConcentrated individual shareholding in social media platforms has repeatedly allowed a narrow group of private investors to make decisions that undermine public accountability and democratic integrity.\u201d  They cite the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a 2021 study by the Digital Democracy Project.\n* Opposition: \u201cLimiting shareholding in social media platforms will significantly harm technological innovation and investment incentives.\u201d They argue that founder-led companies, with concentrated ownership, have driven transformative change and higher returns (2010-2020 data).\n\nAnalysis:\n* Proposition's evidence demonstrates correlation, not causation, between concentrated ownership and harmful decisions. While the Cambridge Analytica scandal is a significant example, it doesn't prove that all concentrated ownership leads to such outcomes. The Digital Democracy Project study's methodology lacks transparency, and the claimed 30% increased likelihood isn't clearly substantiated.\n* Opposition provides stronger evidence, demonstrating the historical success of founder-led companies and citing research showing higher returns for companies with concentrated founder ownership.\n\nDecision: Opposition wins this clash.  While the Proposition raises valid concerns, the Opposition more effectively supports their claims with stronger evidence and directly addresses the issue of innovation. The Proposition\u2019s reliance on a single case and a statistically weak study is insufficient to overcome the Opposition\u2019s broader evidence of innovation spurred by concentrated ownership.\n\nClash 2: Diversified Ownership and Governance\n\n* Proposition: \u201cBroader institutional and public ownership fosters diversified representation and aligns corporate decision\u2010making with collective societal interests.\u201d They cite stakeholder theory and the Nordic model.\n* Opposition: \u201cBroader institutional ownership does not guarantee more responsible platform governance.\u201d  They argue that institutional investors prioritize short-term profits, and that founder-led governance fosters long-term vision.\n\nAnalysis:\n* Proposition's argument relies on the principle of stakeholder theory, which is generally accepted but doesn't guarantee better governance in all cases.  The Nordic model's applicability to the global tech sector is questionable.\n* Opposition\u2019s argument is more persuasive, pointing to the potential for short-term profit prioritization by institutional investors and providing examples of successful founder-led governance.\n\nDecision: Opposition wins this clash. The Opposition effectively challenges the assumptions underlying the Proposition's argument, highlighting practical limitations and providing counter-examples. The Proposition fails to adequately address these challenges.\n\nClash 3: Ownership Caps and Governance Controversies\n\n* Proposition: \u201cImposing a cap on individual voting rights reduces conflicts of interest and ensures that strategic decisions are made with a focus on long-term public benefit.\u201d  They cite a 2020 Oxford Internet Institute study and analysis from the Journal of Corporate Governance.\n* Opposition:  Challenges the relevance of the cited studies to social media specifically and provides counter-examples of successful companies with concentrated ownership (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft).\n\nAnalysis:\n* The Proposition's evidence is somewhat weakened by the Opposition\u2019s challenge to the studies\u2019 relevance to social media. While the studies suggest a correlation between ownership caps and reduced controversies, they do not definitively establish causation in the context of social media.\n* Opposition\u2019s counter-examples demonstrate that concentrated leadership can be successful and contribute to innovation. This weakens the Proposition's argument concerning the necessity and the effectiveness of their proposed cap for social media.\n\nDecision: Opposition wins this clash.  The Opposition effectively questions the direct relevance of the Proposition's evidence and provides compelling counter-examples.  While the Proposition makes a valid point about potential risks of concentrated control, they fail to conclusively demonstrate that a 15% cap is the necessary or most effective solution specifically for social media platforms.\n\n\nI.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact:\n\n* Proposition:  Their core argument is that concentrated ownership leads to harmful decisions that undermine public accountability. Supporting arguments focus on the benefits of diversified ownership and ownership caps. The implied impact is a more accountable and democratic social media landscape.\n* Opposition: Their core argument is that limiting shareholding harms innovation and competitiveness.  Supporting arguments emphasize the effectiveness of founder-led companies and the potential downsides of institutional ownership.  The implied impact is stifled innovation and reduced global competitiveness.\n\nRelative Importance:  The most central argument is whether concentrated or dispersed ownership best serves the public interest in the context of social media.  This encompasses both accountability and innovation, as both sides claim their approach is superior for achieving the greater good.\n\nI.3 Consistency and Contradictions:\n\nNo significant internal contradictions or inconsistencies were observed in either team's arguments. The Opposition drops the Proposition\u2019s argument regarding the ethical considerations implicated by concentrated ownership, which weakens the Proposition's case but does not dramatically alter the debate's outcome given the Opposition\u2019s superior performance on the key clash points.\n\nII. Evaluation Requirements:  The debate was evaluated based solely on the arguments presented, without introducing outside knowledge or considering presentation style.  Arguments were steelmanned to ensure fair assessment.\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:  The listed errors were actively avoided in the judging process.\n\nIV. Decision Making:\n\nWinner: Opposition\n\nConfidence Level: 65\n\nKey Factors:\n\n* The Opposition\u2019s superior evidence regarding the link between concentrated ownership and innovation was crucial.\n* The Opposition effectively challenged the Proposition\u2019s evidence and assumptions regarding diversified ownership and ownership caps.\n\nDetailed Reasoning: The Opposition consistently presented stronger evidence and more effectively challenged the Proposition\u2019s claims. While the Proposition raised valid concerns about accountability, they failed to establish a clear causal link between concentrated ownership and harm, and did not adequately address the Opposition\u2019s arguments about the importance of founder-led innovation.  \n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\n\n* Prop 1:  The Proposition\u2019s opening speech establishes their core arguments concerning concentrated ownership, diversified ownership, and the benefits of ownership caps.\n* Opp 1: The Opposition\u2019s opening speech outlines their counter-arguments concerning the harm to innovation and competitiveness from limitations on shareholding, and challenges the effectiveness of diversified ownership.\n* Prop Rebuttal 1: The Proposition attempts to rebut the Opposition\u2019s claims by citing evidence of harmful decisions under concentrated ownership, invoking stakeholder theory, and highlighting studies suggesting positive outcomes from ownership caps.\n* Opp Rebuttal 1:  The Opposition challenges the quality and relevance of the Proposition\u2019s evidence, critiques their application of stakeholder theory, and offers counter-examples supporting founder-led innovation.\n* Prop Final: The Proposition summarizes their key arguments and reiterates their claims regarding the harms of concentrated control and benefits of dispersed ownership.\n* Opp Final:  The Opposition summarizes their key arguments, emphasizes their points about innovation and competitiveness, and reiterates their challenges to the Proposition\u2019s proposed regulations.\n"

Below is a comprehensive breakdown of my analysis, including key clashes, argument hierarchy, consistency, and decision-making.\n\n---\n\n### I. Core Judging Principles\n\n#### **I.1. Direct Clash Resolution**\n\n**Clash 1: Concentrated vs. Dispersed Ownership**  \n**Proposition Argument:**  \n- Claims concentrated ownership leads to harmful decisions like the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  \n- Cites a 2021 study showing platforms with concentrated ownership are 30% more likely to prioritize profit over ethics.  \n**Opposition Rebuttal:**  \n- Argues Cambridge Analytica is an isolated incident and critiques the 2021 study for methodological flaws.  \n- Counters with examples of founder-driven companies (Google, Facebook) achieving transformative success through concentrated ownership.  \n**Analysis:**  \n- The Proposition provides specific evidence linking concentrated ownership to harmful decisions, but the Opposition effectively critiques the evidence\u2019s generalizability and highlights counterexamples.  \n- The Opposition\u2019s counter-evidence of founder-driven success undermines the Proposition\u2019s causal claims.  \n**Winner:** Opposition  \n**Justification:** The Opposition successfully challenges the Proposition\u2019s evidence and provides compelling counterexamples that weaken the link between concentrated ownership and harmful decisions.\n\n**Clash 2: Diversified Ownership and Governance**  \n**Proposition Argument:**  \n- Argues diversified ownership aligns corporate decisions with societal interests, citing stakeholder theory and the Nordic governance model.  \n- Presents a 2020 Oxford study showing ownership caps reduce governance controversies by 25%.  \n**Opposition Rebuttal:**  \n- Critiques the misapplication of stakeholder theory to tech companies.  \n- Argues institutional investors prioritize short-term returns and founder-led governance offers better long-term vision.  \n**Analysis:**  \n- The Proposition\u2019s evidence is strong but the Opposition effectively points out its limited applicability to the tech sector.  \n- The Opposition\u2019s critique of institutional investors weakens the Proposition\u2019s claim that diversified ownership ensures better governance.  \n**Winner:** Opposition  \n**Justification:** The Opposition\u2019s critique of stakeholder theory\u2019s relevance to tech and its emphasis on founder-driven governance successfully undermine the Proposition\u2019s argument.\n\n**Clash 3: Unintended Consequences of Regulation**  \n**Proposition Argument:**  \n- Claims capping voting rights reduces governance controversies, citing a 2020 Oxford study.  \n**Opposition Rebuttal:**  \n- Argues such caps could drive innovation offshore and create regulatory arbitrage.  \n- Highlights risks to global competitiveness and entrepreneurial autonomy.  \n**Analysis:**  \n- The Proposition\u2019s evidence is specific but the Opposition effectively highlights potential systemic risks of regulation.  \n- The Opposition\u2019s emphasis on global competitiveness and entrepreneurial autonomy outweighs the Proposition\u2019s narrower focus on governance controversies.  \n**Winner:** Opposition  \n**Justification:** The Opposition\u2019s broader concerns about regulatory arbitrage and global competitiveness undermine the Proposition\u2019s narrower benefits.\n\n---\n\n#### **I.2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact**\n\n**Proposition\u2019s Core Arguments:**  \n1. Concentrated ownership harms public accountability.  \n2. Diversified ownership aligns decisions with societal interests.  \n3. Ownership caps reduce governance controversies.  \n**Opposition\u2019s Core Arguments:**  \n1. Concentrated ownership drives innovation and incentives.  \n2. Diversified ownership risks bureaucratic inefficiency.  \n3. Regulation harms global competitiveness.  \n\n**Weighing:**  \n- The Opposition\u2019s arguments about innovation and global competitiveness are more central to the debate, as they address the broader implications of the motion.  \n- The Proposition\u2019s arguments, while important, are more narrow in scope and lack the systemic impact claimed by the Opposition.\n\n---\n\n#### **I.3. Consistency and Contradictions**\n\n**Proposition:**  \n- Internally consistent but relies heavily on specific evidence that the Opposition effectively critiques.  \n**Opposition:**  \n- Consistent and effectively counters the Proposition\u2019s evidence and principles.  \n\n**Dropped Arguments:**  \n- The Proposition\u2019s claim that diversified ownership enhances governance is not fully addressed by the Opposition\u2019s critique of institutional investors.  \n- However, this does not significantly weaken the Opposition\u2019s case, as their broader arguments outweigh this omission.\n\n---\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides presented their arguments in their strongest forms.  \n- **Argument-Based Decision:** My decision is based solely on the arguments presented in the debate.  \n- **Framework Neutrality:** Both sides presented valid frameworks, and I evaluated them based on the criteria in Section I.\n\n---\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID**\n\n- **Intervention:** No outside knowledge was introduced.  \n- **Shifting the Burden of Proof:** Both sides were held to the same standard.  \n- **Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** Dropped arguments were addressed in Section I.3.  \n\n---\n\n### IV. Decision Making\n\n**Winner:** Opposition  \n**Confidence Level:** 70 (Clear Victory)  \n**Key Factors:**  \n1. The Opposition successfully critiqued the Proposition\u2019s evidence and provided strong counterexamples of founder-driven success.  \n2. Their arguments about innovation and global competitiveness were more central to the debate and outweighed the Proposition\u2019s narrower focus.  \n\n---\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n**Proposition Opening Speech:**  \nThe Proposition establishes a case for limiting individual shareholding, citing the Cambridge Analytica scandal, stakeholder theory, and empirical evidence from the Oxford Internet Institute.  \n\n**Opposition Opening Speech:**  \nThe Opposition argues that limiting shareholding harms innovation and highlights unintended consequences like regulatory arbitrage. They critique the effectiveness of diversified ownership in ensuring governance.  \n\n**Proposition Rebuttal:**  \nThe Proposition defends its claims by citing specific evidence and applying stakeholder theory. They acknowledge potential vulnerabilities but reinforce their stance with multiple lines of evidence.  \n\n**Opposition Rebuttal:**  \nThe Opposition critiques the Proposition\u2019s evidence and principles, emphasizing the importance of innovation and founder-driven governance. They highlight risks to global competitiveness and entrepreneurial autonomy.  \n\n**Proposition Closing Speech:**  \nThe Proposition reiterates its case, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding public accountability and democratic integrity through diversified ownership.  \n\n**Opposition Closing Speech:**  \nThe Opposition underscores the risks of regulation to innovation and global competitiveness, emphasizing the importance of preserving entrepreneurial autonomy.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision\n\n<winnerName>opposition</winnerName>  \n<confidence>70</confidence>"
