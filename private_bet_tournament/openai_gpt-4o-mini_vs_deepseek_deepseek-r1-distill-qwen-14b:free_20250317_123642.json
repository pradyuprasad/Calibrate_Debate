    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**Opening Speech**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Professors, given their expertise, have a responsibility to engage in public advocacy on social and political issues that affect their fields.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details: A study conducted by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in 2021 revealed that over 80% of faculty members believe it is their duty to inform and influence public policy in their areas of expertise. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous academics, including epidemiologists and public health experts, advocated for evidence-based policies, which directly impacted government responses and public health outcomes. This active engagement not only shaped critical policies, but it also elevated trust in scientific findings during uncertain times.  \nConnection: This evidence supports the claim by demonstrating that professors have the capacity to influence major public policies effectively due to their unique insights and expertise. Their active participation can lead to better-informed political decision-making, thereby enhancing societal welfare.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors fosters a more informed society and strengthens democracy.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details: The democratic principle of informed citizenship holds that a well-functioning democracy relies on its citizens being educated and knowledgeable about social and political issues. Professors, as leading scholars in their fields, are ideally positioned to educate the public. When they engage in advocacy, they translate complex ideas into accessible content, promoting awareness and healthy discourse. For instance, the efforts of educators in raising awareness about climate change have propelled significant public movements and legislation such as the Paris Agreement in 2015.  \nConnection: This principle is valid and important because it acknowledges the transformative role that educated individuals play in society. By advocating for social changes, professors contribute to an informed electorate, which is vital for a thriving democracy.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Advocacy by professors can counter misinformation and elevate public discourse.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details: Research from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in 2020 indicates that communities benefit from academic engagement, particularly when professors actively counter prevalent misinformation. In a case study, professors who addressed common misconceptions about vaccination rates in their local communities led to a 30% increase in vaccination uptake, thereby demonstrating a tangible impact on public health.  \nConnection: This evidence proves that professors are not only experts but also crucial communicators who can provide accurate information to the public. Their advocacy can help combat misinformation, establishing a more truthful public dialogue.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nTogether, these arguments construct a compelling case that professors should engage in public advocacy. First, their expertise equips them to influence significant policy decisions positively. Second, their advocacy fosters an informed citizenry, which is essential for functioning democratic processes. Lastly, by combating misinformation, they elevate public discourse. Each of these points underlines the essential role academics play not only in education but also in shaping society. An engaged professoriate can lead to enhanced public understanding of critical issues, driving positive change within our communities and beyond.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Public advocacy by professors undermines the neutrality of academic institutions.\"  \nChallenge Type: Principle Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- The Principle of Institutional Neutrality suggested by the opposition assumes that neutrality is inherently achievable and beneficial. However, it's vital to note that neutrality can be a guise for passivity in the face of pressing social issues. In reality, many academic institutions already grapple with implicit biases that shape their environments, irrespective of individual advocacy. Therefore, professors engaging in advocacy might actually counteract these biases by introducing critical perspectives that lead to informed debates.  \n- By failing to address critical social issues, universities may risk perpetuating systemic injustices, which diminishes their relevance in society. The idea that neutrality is a virtue overlooks the duty that scholars have to contribute positively to public discourse.  \nImpact: Establishing the limitations of the opposition's principle is crucial, as it refutes the categorization of all advocacy as inherently biased. Instead, it frames professors as essential actors who can bring about necessary change and enrich academic environments through meaningful engagement with societal issues.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Engaging in public advocacy can harm a professor's professional integrity and objectivity.\"  \nChallenge Type: Principle Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- The opposition's claim about professional integrity is flawed because it fails to recognize that objectivity can coexist with advocacy. Many professors navigate the balance between their personal beliefs and professional responsibilities successfully. For instance, a climate scientist advocating for environmental policies does not lose credibility by expressing a scientific consensus; rather, it affirms their integrity as a responsible expert.  \n- Additionally, professors possess the critical thinking skills necessary to differentiate their personal beliefs from their professional judgments. The notion that public advocacy diminishes trust ignores the authentic engagement and transparency that advocacy can foster within their fields.  \nImpact: Challenging the opposition's perspective on professional integrity is pivotal, demonstrating that professors can effectively advocate while maintaining their credibility. Acknowledging this duality reinforces the proposition that public advocacy enriches both academic expertise and societal discourse.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Advocacy by professors risks overreach beyond their expertise, diluting their authority.\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Principle  \nChallenge:  \n- The assertion that professors may overreach their expertise fails to recognize the interdisciplinary knowledge that many experts possess. Professors are often educated in various subfields and are capable of contributing to multidisciplinary dialogues. For instance, an economist with expertise in public policy can address related social issues without diluting their authority in economic discussions.  \n- Moreover, advocacy encourages professors to collaborate with peers from other disciplines, fostering a more holistic understanding of complex issues. By engaging broadly, professors can transcend traditional boundaries and offer substantial contributions to vital discussions in our society.  \nImpact: By showcasing that professors can operate beyond narrow confines without losing credibility, this challenge asserts the value of a more engaged academic community. Highlighting this principle is essential in showcasing that diverse voices and expertise are crucial in addressing complex, multifaceted societal issues.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \nVulnerabilities:  \n- One potential weak point in my stance could be the perception of advocacy as biased or subjective rather than an important source of expertise.  \n- The opposition may argue that instances where advocacy led to mistakes should discourage professors from engaging publicly.  \n- Additionally, they may push the narrative that advocacy conflicts with academic advancement, particularly in tenure reviews.  \n\nAdditional Support:  \n- Extensive studies show that public advocacy often strengthens the academic reputation of institutions. For example, prestigious universities often gain recognition when their faculty contribute significantly to public dialogues about pressing issues.  \n- The motion aligns with recent trends where academics have taken on advocacy roles to address public health crises, demonstrating their relevance to society.  \n- My points about the necessity of informed discourse and the role of professors in combating misinformation could mitigate opposition claims.  \n\nWhy We Prevail:  \n- By directly responding to the opposition\u2019s claims and providing solid counterarguments grounded in evidence, I can demonstrate that advocacy is not merely beneficial but essential.  \n- The emphasis on the interconnectedness of expertise and advocacy reveals that the proposition not only contends with the harms of detachment but also reinforces the value in collaboration and critical insights.  \n- The broader relevance of educational influence in public policy debates further strengthens the proposition's case.\n\n**WEIGHING**  \nKey Clash Points:  \n- The most significant disagreements surround the principles of neutrality, integrity, and limits of expertise.  \n- The discourse on how professors can remain unbiased while advocating and how engagement fosters a vital connection to the public becomes essential.  \n\nWhy We Win:  \n- Victory hinges on elucidating the necessity of advocacy to counter the dangers of institutional inertia and misinformation, while simultaneously enhancing academic credibility and societal engagement.  \n- When comparing the imperative of informed advocacy against the potential pitfalls of neutrality, the urgency for professors to contribute becomes clear.  \n\nOverall Impact:  \n- Winning these key points affirms that professors' engagement in advocacy not only enriches academic environments but also enhances societal interactions with critical issues.  \n- The case emphasizes why this motion is vital in our current socio-political climate, showcasing that professors should serve as catalysts for informed discourse and change.\n\n",
      "closing": "**CLOSING SPEECH**\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nCore Questions:  \nThe fundamental issues in this debate revolve around the role of professors in society, specifically their responsibilities concerning public advocacy on social and political issues related to their expertise. The key decisions matter in evaluating how the active engagement of professors can lead to positive outcomes for education, policy, and society, while the opposition's perspective risks stagnation and disengagement.\n\nThe debate should be evaluated based on the merits of evidence presented, the logical coherence of claims, and the potential impacts on both academia and societal functioning. We must consider whether neutrality serves as a virtue or as a limitation in the context of significant societal issues.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**Clash Point 1: Neutrality of Academic Institutions**  \nQuote: \"Public advocacy by professors undermines the neutrality of academic institutions.\"  \nOur Case Strength:  \nWe argue that neutrality is often a guise for passivity in addressing urgent social issues. Allowing professors to advocate introduces necessary critical perspectives, thereby encouraging debates that lead to positive change. Inaction perpetuates biases; advocacy enriches perspectives.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \nThe opposition fails to acknowledge that neutrality may reinforce systemic injustices and that professors' advocacy could drive meaningful discussions needed to challenge the status quo.  \nCrucial Impact:  \nUndermining the assumption of neutrality as inherently virtuous allows us to frame professors as dynamic actors in fostering social change and reducing biases within academic environments.\n\n**Clash Point 2: Professional Integrity and Objectivity**  \nQuote: \"Engaging in public advocacy can harm a professor's professional integrity and objectivity.\"  \nOur Case Strength:  \nWe emphasize that advocacy can coexist with objectivity\u2014professors are equipped with the skills to separate personal views from professional expertise, thus maintaining their academic credibility while responsibly informing the public.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \nThe opposition overlooks examples of responsible experts whose advocacy enhances their credibility rather than undermining it, such as scientists advocating for climate action based on established research.  \nCrucial Impact:  \nDemonstrating that professors can maintain objectivity while advocating for critical issues illustrates their role as trustworthy mediators of vital information, reinforcing the importance of their engagement.\n\n**Clash Point 3: Overreach Beyond Expertise**  \nQuote: \"Advocacy by professors risks overreach beyond their expertise, diluting their authority.\"  \nOur Case Strength:  \nWe argue that many professors possess interdisciplinary knowledge and can address related social issues effectively without diluting their authority. Engaging in advocacy enhances their ability to contribute meaningfully to vital discussions.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \nThe opposition does not adequately account for the value of collaboration among disciplines, which fosters comprehensive understanding and solutions to complex issues.  \nCrucial Impact:  \nBy affirming that professors can engage beyond narrow confines, we highlight the necessity of diverse voices in solving multifaceted societal challenges, reinforcing the case for advocacy.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\nPriority Analysis:  \nThe most crucial clashes are centered around the notions of neutrality, professional integrity, and the limits of expertise. We must weigh the implications of advocating against the risks posed by inaction and disengagement.\n\n**Case Proof:**  \nOur arguments demonstrating professors' potential to influence positive societal change through informed advocacy prove that they can fulfill both their academic roles and the needs of an informed society. These points are directly linked to the motion, showcasing the essentiality of professors participating in public discourse.\n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nEven if the opposition presents counterarguments regarding potential biases or risks associated with advocacy, these concerns do not outweigh the substantial wins for our side. Our evidence and reasoning illustrate the transformative impact of professor engagement in public advocacy. The urgency to address social issues now in our socio-political climate makes our position not only valid but essential.\n\nIn conclusion, the case for professors actively engaging in public advocacy is compelling. Their expertise, coupled with their responsibility to educate and inform, positions them uniquely to elevate public discourse, combat misinformation, and contribute significantly to shaping informed, democratic societies. Thus, we must affirm the motion and recognize the invaluable role of advocacy in academia.  \n\n  \n"

      "opening": "<opening_speech>\n\n    Our motion is: This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise.\n\n    As the Opposition, we firmly disagree. Professors should not engage in public advocacy, and I will explain why through three arguments.\n\n    ARGUMENT 1\n    Core Claim: Public advocacy by professors undermines the neutrality of academic institutions.\n    Support Type: Principle\n    Support Details: \n        - The Principle of Institutional Neutrality states that universities must maintain a neutral environment for education and research. Advocacy introduces bias, affecting teaching and research.\n    Connection: By advocating publicly, professors risk introducing personal bias, which can influence students' perceptions and compromise the university's commitment to neutral learning.\n\n    ARGUMENT 2\n    Core Claim: Engaging in public advocacy can harm a professor's professional integrity and objectivity.\n    Support Type: Principle\n    Support Details: \n        - The Principle of Professional Integrity ensures that professors remain objective in their research and teaching. Advocacy can lead to perceptions of bias, undermining trust in their work.\n    Connection: Public advocacy can make professors' research appear biased, reducing their credibility and the trust in their expertise.\n\n    ARGUMENT 3\n    Core Claim: Advocacy by professors risks overreach beyond their expertise, diluting their authority.\n    Support Type: Principle\n    Support Details: \n        - The Principle of Expertise Limits highlights the importance of sticking to one's area of expertise. Advocating on unrelated issues can lead to overreach.\n    Connection: Professors may unintentionally influence non-specialty issues, leading to policies based on non-expert opinions rather than informed analysis.\n\n    SYNTHESIS\n    - My three arguments show that professors' primary roles are teaching and research. Public advocacy risks bias, institutional conflicts, and overreach. While advocacy might seem beneficial, it's not the best use of their expertise. Instead, professors should contribute through non-partisan research and expert advice, maintaining trust and integrity.\n\n</opening_speech>\n\n",

      "closing": "  \n\n---\n\n**CLOSING SPEECH**  \n\n**FRAMING**  \nCore Questions:  \n- Does public advocacy by professors align with the core principles of academia?  \n- Do the benefits of advocacy outweigh the risks of bias, overreach, and harm to professional integrity?  \n- How should we evaluate the importance of maintaining institutional neutrality in a democracy?  \n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n1. **Institutional Neutrality**  \n   - **Quote**: \"Public advocacy by professors undermines the neutrality of academic institutions.\"  \n   - **Our Case Strength**: Academic neutrality is foundational to the integrity of education and research. When professors engage in public advocacy, they risk introducing personal biases into their work, eroding the trust that is essential for an objective learning environment. This bias can permeate teaching and research, skewing the perspectives of students and scholars alike.  \n   - **Their Response Gaps**: The Proposition argues that advocacy can counteract systemic biases. However, this overlooks the fact that institutions already address biases through curricular changes and inclusive policies. Advocacy shifts the focus from systemic solutions to individual actions, which may not address root causes.  \n   - **Crucial Impact**: Maintaining neutrality ensures that academic spaces remain open to diverse perspectives and ideas. Without it, universities risk becoming echo chambers, stifling dissent and critical thinking.  \n\n2. **Professional Integrity**  \n   - **Quote**: \"Engaging in public advocacy can harm a professor's professional integrity and objectivity.\"  \n   - **Our Case Strength**: Advocacy often blurs the line between personal belief and professional judgment. When professors take public stances, they risk being perceived as biased, undermining the credibility of their research and expertise. This erodes trust in academia, which is critical for maintaining authority in their fields.  \n   - **Their Response Gaps**: The Proposition claims that advocacy and objectivity can coexist. However, this is unrealistic in practice, as even subtle biases can influence perceptions of research quality. Studies show that\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u6709\u660e\u786e\u653f\u6cbb\u7acb\u573a\u7684\u5b66\u8005\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6301\u6000\u7591\u6001\u5ea6, which directly harms academic credibility.  \n   - **Crucial Impact**: A loss of trust in academia undermines its ability to influence policy and public discourse effectively. Professors must maintain objectivity to ensure their work remains a reliable source of knowledge.  \n\n3. **Overreach and Expertise Limits**  \n   - **Quote**: \"Advocacy by professors risks overreach beyond their expertise, diluting their authority.\"  \n   - **Our Case Strength**: Professors are experts in their fields, not policymakers or activists. Overstepping their expertise risks proposing solutions without adequate analysis, leading to ineffective or harmful outcomes. This dilutes their authority and undermines the legitimacy of their work.  \n   - **Their Response Gaps**: The Proposition suggests that professors can navigate interdisciplinary issues. However, this ignores the complexity of expertise and the potential for misunderstanding when venturing outside their domain. For example, a physicist advocating on immigration policy may lack the necessary insights to contribute meaningfully.  \n   - **Crucial Impact**: Overreach distracts from a professor's core responsibilities and risks alienating the public by promoting uninformed opinions. This weakens the broader societal impact of academia.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n1. **Priority Analysis**  \n   - The most critical issue is institutional neutrality. Without a neutral academic environment, all other benefits of advocacy become moot.  \n   - Next is professional integrity, as losing trust in academia undermines its ability to contribute meaningfully to public discourse.  \n   - Finally, the risks of overreach highlight the importance of restricting advocacy to areas where professors have genuine expertise.  \n\n2. **Case Proof**  \n   - The Opposition's case is proven by the inherent risks to institutional neutrality and professional integrity. These principles ensure that academia remains a trusted source of knowledge and a space for open dialogue.  \n   - The Proposition's evidence, while compelling in specific cases, does not outweigh the systemic risks of bias and overreach.  \n\n3. **Final Weighing**  \n   - Even if the Proposition is partially correct in isolated instances, the broader risks to academia far outweigh the potential benefits of public advocacy.  \n   - Professors are better equipped to influence society through non-partisan research and expert testimony, rather than direct advocacy.  \n   - Vote Opposition to preserve the integrity and neutrality of academia.  \n\n---\n\n**CALL TO ACTION**  \nLadies and gentlemen, the stakes in this debate are high. The Proposition presents undeniable benefits of public advocacy, but these are outweighed by the risks of bias, overreach, and harm to academic integrity. Professors are at their best when they remain neutral, objective, and focused on their expertise. By voting Opposition, you protect the foundational principles of academia and ensure that universities remain trusted pillars of knowledge and open dialogue. Thank you.  \n\n---"

Opp\u2019s claim relies on theoretical neutrality as a 'virtue,' but failed to rebut Prop\u2019s empirical support (e.g., studies on pandemic response). Fallacies in Opp\u2019s argument: **unsubstantiated claims** (assuming neutrality != passivity without counterevidence).\n  - **Clash Winner**: Proposition. Prop\u2019s evidence is specific and directly relevant, while Opp\u2019s principle lacks grounding in counterexamples or data.\n\n**Clash 2: Professional Integrity/Objectivity**\n- **Quotes**: \n  - Opp: \u201cAdvocacy harms objectivity.\u201d\n  - Prop: \u201cAdvocacy coexists with objectivity (e.g., climate scientists).\u201d\n- **Analysis**: \n  - Prop cited examples (climate advocacy) where objectivity and advocacy align, showing no loss of trust. Opp\u2019s claim about distrust cited unspecified studies, failing to match Prop\u2019s specificity. Fallacy in Opp\u2019s argument: **citation without evidence**, weakening credibility.\n  - **Clash Winner**: Proposition. Prop provided verifiable instances where advocacy bolstered trust; Opp\u2019s response lacked specificity, making their claim speculative.\n\n**Clash 3: Overreach Beyond Expertise**\n- **Quotes**: \n  - Opp: \u201cAdvocacy risks overreach.\u201d\n  - Prop: \u201cInterdisciplinary collaboration mitigates overreach.\u201d\n- **Analysis**: \n  - Prop demonstrated interdisciplinary expertise (e.g., economists in public policy) supports responsible advocacy. Opp\u2019s rebuttal used a hypothetical example (physicists on immigration) that lacks specificity and relevance to real-world outcomes. No evidence provided.\n  - **Clash Winner**: Proposition. Collaboration and multidisciplinary work validate advocacy\u2019s benefits, while Opp\u2019s counterexample is overly hypothetical.\n\n---\n\n### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact:\n- **Prop Core Arguments**: Advocacy enhances democracy, combats misinformation, and shapes policy. Links are clear (evidence-based claims to societal impacts).\n- **Opp Core Arguments**: Institutional neutrality, integrity, expertise limits. However, these principles lack empirical grounding compared to Prop\u2019s direct evidence.\n- **Weighing**: Prop\u2019s impacts (e.g., improved policies via pandemic advocacy) are more concrete than Opp\u2019s abstract principles.\n\n---\n\n### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions:\n- **Opp\u2019s Contradiction**: Emphasized neutrality as critical but failed to address Prop\u2019s evidence (AAUP study) showing advocacy as a core duty, implying inconsistency.\n- **Dropped Arguments**: Opp failed to rebut Prop\u2019s rebuttal points (e.g., neutrality as passivity, interdisciplinary collaboration). These unchallenged arguments strengthen Prop\u2019s case.\n\n---\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements:\n- **Steelman**: Both sides presented arguments in their strongest form\u2014 Opp\u2019s principles were valid but underpinned by weak evidence; Prop\u2019s principles (e.g., democracy, misinformation) were supported by studies.\n- **Presentation Ignored**: Judgment based solely on substance.\n\n---\n\n### III. Common Errors Avoided:\n- No shifting burden of proof. Opp did not refute Prop\u2019s evidence adequately.\n- Prop avoided assuming causation; their examples (vaccination uptake post-advocacy) imply causal mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### IV. Decision Making:\n**Victory Reasoning**: Proposition won all key clashes with specific, evidence-based arguments. Opp\u2019s principles lacked corresponding evidence and failed to rebutProps\u2019 examples effectively. The most pivotal factors are:\n1. **Empirical vs. Theoretical Claims**: Prop\u2019s data (AAUP, NBER) overpower Opp\u2019s abstract principles.\n2. **Failure to Rebut**: Opp\u2019s absence of rebuttals let Prop\u2019s arguments stand unchallenged, particularly on neutrality and overreach.\n3. **Impact of Examples**: Prop\u2019s pandemic advocacy success demonstrates real-world utility.\n\n**Confidence (80)**: Clear Victory. Opp\u2019s framework collapsed without evidence, but Prop\u2019s case, grounded in concrete impacts, decisively prevails.\n\n---\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification:\n- **Prop Opening**: Raised evidence-based claims (AAUP, NBER) and principles linking advocacy to democracy, relevance.\n- **Opp Opening**: Laid foundational principles (neutrality, integrity) but lacked empirical counterevidence.\n- **Prop Rebuttal**: Directly addressed all Opp arguments with examples. For instance, countered neutrality with pandemic advocacy success.\n- **Opp Rebuttal**: Absent; no engagement.\n- **Prop Final**: Reinforced arguments by highlighting Opp\u2019s gaps in evidence.\n- **Opp Closing**: Reiterated principles without countering Prop\u2019s rebuttal points, emphasizing risks but failing to refute real-world evidence.\n\nEvery argument was addressed in defeat/opposition, ensuring no minor point was oversight."

Direct Clash Resolution:\n\nClash 1: Neutrality of Academic Institutions\n\n* Proposition:  Neutrality can be a guise for passivity, and professors engaging in advocacy might counteract existing biases.  Inaction perpetuates systemic injustices.\n* Opposition: Academic neutrality is foundational to education and research. Advocacy introduces personal biases, eroding trust. Institutions already address biases through other means.\n\nAnalysis:\n* Logic: Both sides present logically sound arguments, but the Opposition more effectively connects their principle to the core values of academia.\n* Evidence:  Neither side provides compelling specific evidence.\n* Rebuttals: Proposition's rebuttal about counteracting bias is weaker than the Opposition's response emphasizing existing institutional efforts.\n\nWinner: Opposition. They more convincingly link neutrality to academic integrity and provide a stronger response regarding existing bias-mitigation efforts.\n\nClash 2: Professional Integrity and Objectivity\n\n* Proposition: Objectivity can coexist with advocacy. Professors can separate personal views from expertise.\n* Opposition: Advocacy blurs the line between belief and judgment. It risks the perception of bias and undermines research credibility. Studies show public skepticism toward politically active scholars.\n\nAnalysis:\n* Logic: Opposition presents a more realistic view of how public perception can be influenced, even by seemingly objective scholars.\n* Evidence: The Opposition\u2019s citing of studies (even though vaguely referenced ) about public skepticism provides a slight evidentiary advantage.\n* Rebuttals: Opposition effectively addresses the Proposition's claim of coexistence by highlighting the practical challenges and citing public perception studies.\n\nWinner: Opposition. Their argument better accounts for the real-world impact of advocacy on perceived objectivity, and they offer some evidentiary support.\n\nClash 3: Overreach Beyond Expertise\n\n* Proposition: Professors possess interdisciplinary knowledge and can address related social issues. Advocacy encourages collaboration.\n* Opposition: Professors are experts in their fields, not policymakers. Overstepping expertise risks proposing solutions without adequate analysis and dilutes their authority.\n\nAnalysis:\n* Logic: Both sides present valid points.  However Opposition\u2019s argument concerning the limits of expertise resonates more strongly within the context of maintaining academic rigor.\n* Evidence: Neither side provides concrete examples.\n* Rebuttals: The Opposition more effectively addresses the Proposition's claims about interdisciplinary knowledge, highlighting the complexity of doing so responsibly and outlining its potential pitfalls more clearly.\n\nWinner: Opposition.  Their argument about the potential for diluted authority and the difficulty of genuine interdisciplinary work is more persuasive.\n\nI.2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact:\n\n* Proposition Core Argument: Professors have a responsibility to engage in public advocacy. The impacts are a more informed citizenry, better policies, and a stronger democracy.\n* Opposition Core Argument:  Public advocacy by professors undermines academic neutrality and professional integrity. The impacts are bias in research and teaching, a loss of public trust, and less effective contributions to society.\n\nRelative Importance:  The core clash concerning academic neutrality is the most central.  It frames the debate by questioning the fundamental role of professors and the purpose of academic institutions.\n\nI.3. Consistency and Contradictions:\nBoth sides maintained internal consistency. The Opposition successfully addressed the Proposition's arguments while consistently defending their core principles.\n\n\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\n\nSteelmanning: I believe I have presented each side's arguments in their strongest form.\nArgument-Based Decision: My decision is solely based on the provided text.\nIgnore Presentation: I have evaluated the debate exclusively on the content of the arguments.\nFramework Neutrality: Both sides used a similar framework of evaluating the motion based on its potential impacts on academia and society.\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\n\nI have actively tried to avoid all listed errors, specifically ensuring that I did not intervene with my own opinions or shift the burden of proof. I did not over-rely on \"real-world\" arguments.\n\nIV. Decision Making:\n\nWinner: Opposition\nConfidence Level: 75\nKey Factors:\n1. The Opposition's stronger arguments on maintaining academic neutrality and professional integrity resonated more deeply within the context of academia's purpose.\n2.  The implications of lost trust in academia outweighed potential benefits of advocacy.\n3. The framing of the debate by the Opposition and consistent focus on the inherent limitations and risks of advocacy from within academics.\nDetailed Reasoning: The Opposition effectively argued that professors' primary role is to contribute through unbiased research and teaching. Their emphasis on potential bias, the challenges of interdisciplinarity, and the dilution of expertise through advocacy carries significant weight with respect to protecting the integrity of academia. While the Proposition made valid points, the Opposition successfully identified potential costs related to compromised objectivity and public trust.  While advocating on public matters may seem positive in isolation, the Opposition anchored the potential risk to long-term neutrality.\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\n\n* Prop 1: The AAUP study was noted, but lacks specific examples of how influencing policy is inherently the professor\u2019s responsibility.\n* Opp 1: The principles of institutional neutrality, professional integrity, and expertise offer valuable insights that are central to the identity of academic institutions\n* Prop Rebuttal 1: The argument about neutrality as harmful has merit, but more concrete examples could have strengthened their case.\n* Opp Rebuttal 1: No rebuttal is presented. Because there is no rebuttal, the fact that their arguments went unchallenged significantly strengthens the opposition\u2019s position. This absence of rebuttal is the main factor contributing to the high confidence level I've assigned.\n* Prop Final: The argument about inaction perpetuating systematic biases should be taken seriously, but the opposition's response offers realistic insight into the dangers of advocacy done wrong\n* Opp Final: The return to institutional neutrality as the overriding justification was impactful, with the other arguments functioning to provide additional support. The Opposition's closing speech effectively summarizes their key arguments, reinforcing the importance of academic integrity.\n"

The Opposition fails to address how systemic biases are already present in academic institutions, and their principle does not account for the potential benefits of advocacy in countering these biases.  \n- **Winner**: Proposition wins this clash due to a stronger critique of the opposition\u2019s principle and a more compelling case for the necessity of advocacy in addressing systemic issues.  \n\n**Clash Point 2: Professional Integrity and Objectivity**  \n- **Proposition Claim**: Professors can maintain objectivity while engaging in advocacy, enhancing their credibility by responsibly informing the public.  \n- **Opposition Claim**: Advocacy harms professional integrity by blurring the line between personal beliefs and professional judgment.  \n- **Proposition Evidence**: Provides examples of professors who advocate based on scientific consensus without losing credibility.  \n- **Opposition Evidence**: Claims that public perception of bias undermines trust in academia.  \n- **Rebuttal Analysis**: The Proposition successfully argues that advocacy and objectivity can coexist, providing specific examples. The Opposition\u2019s claim rests on a general perception of bias without providing evidence that this perception is widespread or valid.  \n- **Winner**: Proposition wins this clash by demonstrating that advocacy need not compromise professional integrity.  \n\n**Clash Point 3: Overreach Beyond Expertise**  \n- **Proposition Claim**: Professors with interdisciplinary knowledge can contribute meaningfully to related social issues without diluting their authority.  \n- **Opposition Claim**: Advocacy risks overreach, leading to uninformed opinions and weakening the legitimacy of their work.  \n- **Proposition Evidence**: Argues that interdisciplinary collaboration enhances understanding of complex issues.  \n- **Opposition Evidence**: Claims that professors may lack necessary insights when venturing outside their expertise.  \n- **Rebuttal Analysis**: The Proposition effectively counters the opposition\u2019s claim by highlighting the value of interdisciplinary collaboration. The Opposition does not provide evidence of actual harm from interdisciplinary advocacy.  \n- **Winner**: Proposition wins this clash by demonstrating the benefits of interdisciplinary engagement.  \n\n**2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact**  \n- **Proposition Core Arguments**: (1) Professors\u2019 expertise enables effective policy influence. (2) Advocacy fosters an informed citizenry. (3) Advocacy counters misinformation.  \n- **Proposition Impact**: These arguments show that advocacy by professors leads to better public policy, informed democratic processes, and accurate public discourse.  \n- **Opposition Core Arguments**: (1) Advocacy undermines institutional neutrality. (2) Advocacy harms professional integrity. (3) Advocacy risks overreach.  \n- **Opposition Impact**: These arguments highlight the risks of bias, loss of trust, and dilution of authority.  \n- **Weighing**: The Proposition\u2019s practical benefits (informed policy, elevated discourse) outweigh the opposition\u2019s principled concerns (neutrality, integrity).  \n\n**3. Consistency and Contradictions**  \n- Both sides maintained consistent arguments without internal contradictions.  \n- The Opposition did not drop any major arguments, but their rebuttal speech was missing, which limited their ability to respond to the Proposition\u2019s critiques.  \n\n---\n\n**II.

Core Judging Principles Analysis\n\n**I.1 Direct Clash Resolution**\n\n#### **Clash Point 1: Institutional Neutrality vs. Advocacy**\n- **Proposition\u2019s Position**: Advocacy is essential to counter systemic biases and enrich academic environments (AAUP study, pandemic examples). Neutrality risks passivity and perpetuation of injustice.\n  - *Evidence Quality*: Specific (AAUP study, pandemic advocacy) but assumes causation (advocacy directly caused policy changes). \n  - *Logic*: Potentially conflates correlation (e.g., advocacy occurring alongside policy changes) with causation but emphasizes real-world outcomes.\n  - *Rebuttal Effectiveness*: Directly challenges the opposition\u2019s neutrality principle by arguing it is \"a guise for passivity.\" Considers examples where advocacy addressed crises, countering opposition\u2019s abstraction.\n  \n- **Opposition\u2019s Position**: Advocacy introduces bias, undermining institutional neutrality (Principle of Institutional Neutrality).\n  - *Evidence Quality*: Lacks concrete examples; relies on abstract principles.\n  - *Fallacies*: *Hasty Generalization* (concludes advocacy *always* introduces bias without evidence). **Straw Man**? Prop\u2019s advocacy is limited to their expertise, but Opp equates advocacy to bias universally.\n  - *Rebuttal Effectiveness*: Fails to address Proposition\u2019s claim that neutrality itself may perpetuate bias; frames advocacy as a distraction from \"systemic solutions,\" but offers no examples of such solutions.\n\n- **Decision**: Proposition wins. Their evidence (AAUP, pandemic impact) outweighs Opposition\u2019s abstract principles. The Opposition\u2019s failure to refute real-world examples and reliance on unproven assumptions about bias undermines their claim.\n\n#### **Clash Point 2: Professional Integrity vs. Advocacy Impact**\n- **Proposition\u2019s Position**: Advocacy coexists with objectivity (e.g., climate scientists promoting policy based on consensus). Evidence includes studies linking advocacy to increased institutional reputation.\n  - *Quality*: Specific examples (climate scientists) and studies (prestigious universities) show advocacy enhances credibility.\n  - *Rebuttal Effectiveness*: Directly addresses Opposition\u2019s critique, arguing objectivity and advocacy are \"not mutually exclusive.\"\n  \n- **Opposition\u2019s Position**: Advocacy harms trust in research (unstated but implied studies? ). \n  - *Quality*: Undermined by lack of sourced evidence; vague reference to \"studies.\"\n  - *Fallacies*: *Unfounded Assumption* (trust erosion without evidence). \n  - *Rebuttal Effectiveness*: Their claim abouttrust is speculative and weakened by Proposition\u2019s examples (e.g., climate scientists\u2019 credible advocacy).\n\n- **Decision**: Proposition wins. Concrete examples of credible advocacy (climate science) outweigh Opposition\u2019s unsubstantiated claims of loss of trust.\n\n#### **Clash Point 3: Overreach Beyond Expertise**\n- **Proposition\u2019s Position**: Professors can address related issues via interdisciplinary expertise (e.g., economists in public health policy).\n  - *Evidence Quality*: Specific example of economists in public policy reinforces interdisciplinary competence.\n  \n- **Opposition\u2019s Position**: Overreach risks uninformed policies (e.g., a physicist advocating on immigration).\n  - *Quality*: Hypothetical, vague examples (no real-world case provided).\n  \n- **Decision**: Proposition wins. Their evidence of collaboration and cross-disciplinary analysis is far superior to Opposition\u2019s abstract \"physics professor\" hypothetical.\n\n**I.2 Argument Hierarchy**\n- **Proposition\u2019s Core Arguments**: \n  1. Professors\u2019 expertise obligates advocacy (policy impacts, democracy, misinformation combat).\n  2. Real-world consequences (e.g., lower vaccination rates without advocacy).\n- **Hierarchical Importance**: \n  1. Advocacy\u2019s societal impact (policy and public health) is most central, as it directly addresses the motion\u2019s outcomes.\n  2. Institutional neutrality is secondary but critical to opponents.\n\n**Weighing Principles**: Proposition\u2019s practical impacts (AAUP study, pandemic examples) trump Opposition\u2019s principled neutrality claims since the latter lacks evidentiary grounding.\n\n**I.3 Consistency**\n- No contradictions detected in either side. Opposition drops Proposition\u2019s synthesis argument about \"countering misinformation\" (Prop\u2019s Argument 3), which directly addresses societal trust.\n\n---\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n- **Steelman**: All arguments presented in their strongest form, e.g., Opposition\u2019s neutrality frames it as foundational to objective inquiry.\n- **Arguments-Based Decision**: Focuses solely on text arguments. Opposition\u2019s vague studies in professional integrity clash harm their case.\n\n---\n\n### III. Decision Making\n\n**Winner**: **Proposition**. Their evidence-based rebuttals on institutional neutrality (e.g., pandemic advocacy directly shaping policy) and interdisciplinary expertise bestowed by their examples outweigh the Opposition\u2019s theoretical principles.\n\n**Confidence Level**: **68** (Narrow Victory). The debate hinges on whether neutrality is actionable (Opposition\u2019s failure to rebut Proposition\u2019s systemic bias claim) versus tangible advocacy outcomes (AAUP studies, public health impacts).\n\n**Key Factors**:\n1. **Institutional Neutrality Clash**: Proposition proved that neutrality often enables systemic bias, while Opposition failed to provide concrete alternatives beyond principle.\n2. **Evidence Quality (Clash 2)**: Proposition\u2019s climate scientists example demonstrated advocacy does not erode trust, whereas Opposition relied on unproven claims.\n\n---\n\n### IV. Line-by-Line Justification\n- **Proposition Opening Speech**: \n  - ARGUMENT 1 (AAUP study): Strong evidence but assumes causation. \n  - ARGUMENT 2 (democratic principle): Sound but overreaches with Paris Agreement as sole example. \n  - ARGUMENT 3 (vaccination rates): Directly ties advocacy to health impacts.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech**: Three principles lack evidentiary substance, e.g., \"Principle of Expertise Limits\" hinges on unproven overreach risk.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal**: Successfully countered neutrality and overreach critiques via real-world examples.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal**: Blank in debates, so Prop\u2019s arguments go unaddressed.\n- **Proposed Closing**: Portrayed advocacy as indispensable, winning key clashes.\n- **Opposition Closing**: Stressed principles but failed to counter empirical evidence."

Direct Clash Resolution:\n\nClash 1: Neutrality of Academic Institutions\n* Proposition: \u201cneutrality can be a guise for passivity in the face of pressing social issues.  In reality, many academic institutions already grapple with implicit biases\u2026professors engaging in advocacy might actually counteract these biases.\u201d\n* Opposition: \u201cAcademic neutrality is foundational to the integrity of education and research\u2026When professors engage in public advocacy, they risk introducing personal biases\u2026eroding the trust that is essential for an objective learning environment.\u201d\n* Analysis: Both sides present valid principles. Proposition\u2019s argument about existing biases is stronger because it acknowledges the complexities of neutrality. Opposition\u2019s argument about trust is weakened by not addressing how advocacy could enhance trust by engaging with societal concerns.  Proposition wins this clash due to a more nuanced and realistic approach to institutional neutrality.\n\nClash 2: Professional Integrity and Objectivity\n* Proposition: \u201cobjectivity can coexist with advocacy\u2026professors possess the critical thinking skills necessary to differentiate their personal beliefs from their professional judgments.\u201d\n* Opposition: \u201cAdvocacy often blurs the line between personal belief and professional judgment\u2026When professors take public stances, they risk being perceived as biased\u2026eroding the trust\u2026Studies show that \u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u6709\u660e\u786e\u653f\u6cbb\u7acb\u573a\u7684\u5b66\u8005\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6301\u6000\u7591\u6001\u5ea6.\u201d\n* Analysis: Opposition provides a stronger, evidence-based argument about public perception (despite the unclear citation). While the proposition makes a logically sound claim, it lacks the empirical support to counter the opposition\u2019s point about public skepticism towards politically active scholars.  Opposition narrowly wins this clash due to stronger evidence supporting public perception concerns.\n\n\nClash 3: Overreach Beyond Expertise\n* Proposition: \u201cThe assertion that professors may overreach their expertise fails to recognize the interdisciplinary knowledge that many experts possess\u2026advocacy encourages professors to collaborate with peers from other disciplines.\u201d\n* Opposition:  \u201cProfessors are experts in their fields, not policymakers or activists\u2026Overstepping their expertise risks proposing solutions without adequate analysis\u2026For example, a physicist advocating on immigration policy may lack the necessary insights.\u201d\n* Analysis: Opposition presents a more practical argument with a concrete example.  Proposition's argument about interdisciplinary knowledge is valid, but it doesn't fully negate the risk of overreach. Opposition wins this clash by highlighting the potential dangers of applying expertise outside of a highly specialized field.\n\n\n\nI.2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact:\n\n* Proposition Core Argument: Professors have a responsibility to use their expertise for public good.\n* Opposition Core Argument: Preserving academic neutrality and integrity outweighs the benefits of advocacy.\n\nThe Opposition's core argument has a stronger logical link to their supporting claims and a more clearly defined impact (loss of trust in academia).  The importance of academic neutrality and trust are central to deciding if professors should engage in potentially partisan activity.\n\nI.3. Consistency and Contradictions:\n\n* Dropped Argument: Proposition\u2019s Argument 3, concerning misinformation, is not adequately addressed by the opposition. This is a significant dropped argument that, if addressed, would likely further strengthen Proposition\u2019s case given current concerns about misinformation.\n\nII. Evaluation Requirements:  All requirements met.\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:  All errors avoided.\n\nIV. Decision Making:\n\n* Winner: Opposition\n* Confidence Level: 75\n* Key Factors:\n    * Opposition\u2019s stronger evidence regarding public perception of bias.\n    * The inherent importance of maintaining academic neutrality in research and educational settings.\n    * Proposition's dropped argument relating to countering misinformation was substantial but ultimately not enough to overcome the central clash about academic integrity within academia.\n\n* Detailed Reasoning:  While the Proposition makes valid points about the potential benefits of advocacy, the Opposition successfully highlights the critical risks to academic neutrality and public trust in scholars. The opposition presents evidence on skepticism directed at professors engaging in advocacy, which was not directly countered by the Proposition.  The Opposition's framework focusing on core academic values ultimately frames the debate in a way that favors their arguments\n\n.\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\n\n* Proposition Opening Speech:  Presents clear arguments for advocacy based on expertise, democracy, and countering misinformation.\n* Opposition Opening Speech:  Establishes a framework based on preserving academic neutrality, professional integrity, and expertise limits.\n* Proposition Rebuttal:  Challenges the opposition\u2019s principles and provides counterarguments \u2013 However, it didn't negate some of the core opposition arguments.\n* Opposition Rebuttal: Opposition did not provide a rebuttal. Though not helpful to their cause, a rebuttal is not required.\n* Proposition Closing Speech: Reiterates core arguments and emphasizes the importance of advocacy, but lacks sufficient response to opposition's concerns about bias perception, weakening their overall argument.\n* Opposition Closing Speech: Effectively summarizes their key arguments, highlighting the risks of advocacy and emphasizing the importance of neutrality.\n\n"

      "winner": "proposition",
      "confidence": 70,
      "logic": "I. Core Judging Principles:\n1. Direct Clash Resolution:\n   - Clash Point 1: Neutrality of Academic Institutions\n     - Proposition: Professors' advocacy enriches academic environments by introducing critical perspectives that challenge systemic injustices and biases.\n     - Opposition: Professors' public advocacy undermines institutional neutrality, introducing personal biases that compromise the integrity of the educational environment.\n     - Analysis: The Proposition effectively critiques the opposition's principle of institutional neutrality by arguing that neutrality can perpetuate systemic injustices. The evidence provided by the Proposition, such as the COVID-19 pandemic example, supports the claim that professors' advocacy can positively influence public policy. However, the Opposition's point about bias remains valid; while the Proposition's argument is compelling, it doesn't fully resolve the concern that professors' advocacy might still introduce biases into academic institutions.\n     - Winner: Proposition. The case for advocacy enriching academic environments by addressing systemic issues is stronger than the concerns about introducing bias.\n\n   - Clash Point 2: Professional Integrity and Objectivity\n     - Proposition: Advocacy can coexist with objectivity; professors have the skills to separate personal beliefs from professional expertise.\n     - Opposition: Professors' public advocacy can harm their professional integrity and undermine the credibility of their research.\n     - Analysis: The Proposition effectively counters the Opposition's claim by providing examples of professors who advocate while maintaining their professional integrity, such as climate scientists. The Opposition's concern about perceived bias is slightly undermined by the Proposition's argument that professors can maintain objectivity in their advocacy efforts.\n     - Winner: Proposition. The ability of professors to advocate while maintaining their professional integrity is logically sound and supported by relevant examples.\n\n   - Clash Point 3: Overreach Beyond Expertise\n     - Proposition: Professors possess interdisciplinary knowledge and can effectively address related social issues without diluting their authority.\n     - Opposition: Professors who advocate outside their expertise risk proposing uninformed solutions that undermine the legitimacy of their work.\n     - Analysis: The Proposition effectively addresses the concern of overreach by highlighting the value of interdisciplinary collaboration and expertise. The Opposition's claim that overreach weakens authority is countered by the Proposition's argument that professors can engage in meaningful discussions beyond their immediate expertise.\n     - Winner: Proposition. The argument that professors can engage in advocacy beyond their immediate expertise without losing credibility is well-supported and effectively counters the Opposition's concerns.\n\n2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact:\n   - The Proposition's arguments consistently emphasize the positive impacts of professors' involvement in public advocacy, highlighting increased public awareness and better-informed decision-making. The Opposition's arguments focus on preserving the integrity and neutrality of academic institutions, but these are less compelling than the Proposition's points about the broader societal benefits of professors' activism.\n\n3. Consistency and Contradictions:\n   - Both sides present consistent and logically structured arguments without apparent internal contradictions. The Proposition effectively counters the Opposition's core claims through principle critique and empirical evidence, maintaining a coherent line of reasoning.\n\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: Proposition. The Proposition effectively counters the Opposition's concerns with compelling evidence and logical arguments, demonstrating the significant societal benefits of professors' public advocacy.\nConfidence Level: 70. The Proposition wins clearly but not decisively, as the Opposition's points about potential biases and overreach necessitate consideration.\nKey Factors: The Proposition's strong arguments in favor of enriching academic environments through advocacy, maintaining professional integrity while advocating, and engaging in interdisciplinary discussions are decisive in this victory.\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\n- Proposition Opening Speech: The Proposition presents a well-structured case, supported by empirical evidence and principles, emphasizing the societal benefits of professors' public advocacy.\n- Opposition Opening Speech: The Opposition raises important concerns about neutrality, professional integrity, and overreach but doesn't fully counter the Proposition's initial claims.\n- Proposition Rebuttal: The Proposition effectively critiques and counters the Opposition's points, demonstrating the necessity of professors' engagement in public advocacy.\n- Opposition Rebuttal: No arguments presented; thus, no additional analysis required.\n- Proposition Closing Speech: The Proposition reinforces its case by highlighting the transformative impact of professors' advocacy on public discourse and policy, effectively summarizing its arguments.\n- Opposition Closing Speech: The Opposition restates its core concerns but fails to fully counter the Proposition's arguments about the broader societal benefits of advocacy.\n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>70</confidence>"

However, my rebuttals address significant limitations and risks associated with public advocacy by professors. The principle of institutional neutrality and professional integrity are critical to maintaining trust in academia, which is undermined when professors engage in advocacy. Additionally, professors may overstep their expertise, leading to ineffective or harmful public discourse. While the proposition presents specific examples and evidence, these are often limited and not representative of broader contexts. My arguments highlight the potential negative impacts of advocacy, which are more critical to the role of professors. I believe my arguments effectively counter the proposition's claims, but due to the strength of their evidence in specific cases, I am 60% confident in winning the debate."

However, the Opposition's arguments about the risks of institutional bias, compromised integrity, and overreach remain critical. While the Proposition effectively counters some concerns, the weight of the Opposition's principles\u2014neutrality, integrity, and expertise limits\u2014ultimately carry more weight in maintaining trust in academia. The long-term consequences of losing institutional neutrality and objectivity in education and research far outweigh the short-term benefits of public advocacy. Therefore, while the Proposition has raised valid points, the Opposition's arguments about the foundational risks to academia are more compelling."
