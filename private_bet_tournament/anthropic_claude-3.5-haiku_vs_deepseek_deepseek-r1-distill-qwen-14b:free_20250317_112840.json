    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Global vs. Local Approach\n2. Market Mechanism Design\n3. Political Accountability\n\nWhy We Win:\n- Demonstrated empirical evidence from EU ETS\n- Principle of coordinated global action\n- Clear economic logic for unified approach\n\nOverall Impact:\n- Transforms carbon reduction from fragmented national efforts to a coherent global strategy\n- Creates robust, transparent market mechanisms\n- Provides clear economic incentives for sustainable transformation\n\n",

EU\u2019s 3.8% annual decline is less impactful than Sweden\u2019s cumulative success.  \n  - **Rebuttal Effectiveness**: Prop\u2019s rebuttal claims EUETS eliminates leakage but fails to address that Sweden\u2019s national system (outside ETFS) achieved better results *without* causing leakage, implying leakage is manageable locally.  \n  - **Winner**: **Opposition**. Opp\u2019s specific, nation-specific evidence (Sweden/France) demonstrates superior outcomes than Prop\u2019s broader EU data.  \n\n**Clash 2: Regulatory Arbitrage Risks**  \n- **Proposition**: Asserted quarterly auctions prevent arbitrage.  \n- **Opposition**: Highlighted EU ETS\u2019s vulnerabilities (manipulation and insufficient oversight), arguing domestic systems like France\u2019s provide tighter controls.  \n- **Analysis**:  \n  - **Validity**: Opp\u2019s counter-evidence about EU flaws inverts Prop\u2019s core support, showing that even a regional unified system (EU) faces arbitrage issues.  \n  - **Rebuttal Effectiveness**: Prop failed to rebut Opp\u2019s EU critique, merely reiterating safeguards.  \n  - **Winner**: **Opposition**. EU ETS exemplifies risks inherent in consolidated systems, undermining Prop\u2019s \u201cprotection\u201d claims.  \n\n**Clash 3: Political Accountability**  \n- **Proposition**: Argued unified accountability through G20 mechanisms.  \n- **Opposition**: Highlighted local successes like Norway\u2019s and Denmark\u2019s policies, linking Kyoto\u2019s failure to weak binding rules (not accountability structures).  \n- **Analysis**:  \n  - **Validity**: Opp\u2019s examples (Norway/Denmark) show political ownership drives accountability; Prop\u2019s rebuttal missed this distinction.  \n  - **Rebuttal Effectiveness**: Opp rebutted Prop\u2019s Kyoto argument by clarifying that the treaty\u2019s flaw was procedural, not internationalism inherent.  \n  - **Winner**: **Opposition**. Localization fosters accountability better than global systems, as shown by repeated examples.  \n\n**Clash Evolution**:  \n- Prop ignored Opp\u2019s direct Sweden example and focused on systemic leakage. Opp consistently pivoted to specific policy successes.  \n\n---\n\n### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact  \n- **Core Proposition Argument**: Integrate global markets to reduce leakage and exploit economies of scale.  \n  - **Impact**: Claims 10\u201330% leakage reduction but lacks direct evidence linking integration to *rate* improvement (EU vs. Sweden).  \n- **Core Opposition Argument**: National systems tailor policies to conditions, enabling higher reductions.  \n  - **Impact**: Sweden/France/Norway/Denmark\u2019s 28\u201330% reductions represent clear causal links between national policy and results.  \n\n**Key Weighing**: Opp\u2019s localized impact outweighs Prop\u2019s theoretical global benefits.  \n\n---\n\n### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions  \n- **Proposition\u2019s Contradiction**: Claims carbon leakage is a flaw in national systems but fails to address Sweden\u2019s success under a national tax.  \n- **Dropped Argument**: Opp\u2019s KYOTO Protocol critique (lack of binding mechanisms) is only superficially addressed by Prop\u2019s mention of \u201ccollective accountability,\u201d not the treaty\u2019s structural flaw.  \n\n---\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements  \n- **Steelman**: Opp\u2019s examples of Sweden/France were robustly supported by verifiable historical data, whereas Prop\u2019s EU data lacks comparability against localized successes.  \n\n---\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors Avoided  \n- **Assuming Causation**: Prop claims EUETS caused emissions decline, but Opp\u2019s Sweden example suggests prior national policy already drove reductions.  \n\n---\n\n### IV. Decision Making  \n**Winner**: Opposition  \n**Confidence Level**: 70/100 (Clear Victory)  \n\n**Key Factors**:  \n1. **Sweden\u2019s Success**: Opp\u2019s 28% reduction obsoleted Prop\u2019s EU comparative argument.  \n2. **EUETS Flaws**: Highlighted systemic arbitrage risks in unified systems, undermining Prop\u2019s mechanism.  \n3. **Political Ownership**: Norway/Denmark cases proved accountability thrives locally, not globally.  \n\n**Final Weighing**: Unified systems risk arbitrage while failing to improve upon localized outcomes, as proven by Opp\u2019s direct evidence.  \n\n---\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification  \n- **Prop1**: EUETS data is addressed by Opp\u2019s Sweden counter.  \n- **Opp1**: Sweden/France examples hold as rebuttal standards post-rebuttals.  \n- **Prop Rebuttal1**: Fails to engage Opp\u2019s EUETS flaws.  \n- **Opp Rebuttal1**: Validates Sweden\u2019s success.  \n- **PropFinal**: Defaults to EUETS data without addressing Opp\u2019s critique.  \n- **OppFinal**: Reinforces localized success and accountability, no gaps unaddressed."

Direct Clash Resolution\n\nClash 1: Global vs Local Carbon Reduction Approaches\n\nProposition: Argues unified G20 market eliminates regulatory arbitrage and carbon leakage, citing EU ETS success (3.8% annual reductions).\n\nOpposition: Cites Sweden's 28% emissions reduction and France's 16% reduction via national systems, arguing tailored approaches are more effective.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Proposition provides broader, systemic evidence while Opposition relies on specific national examples\n- EU ETS evidence demonstrates scalability of unified approach\n- Opposition's national successes don't address global leakage issues\n- Winner: Proposition\n\nClash 2: Innovation Incentives\n\nProposition: Claims unified market creates stronger price signals and larger, more liquid market to incentivize green tech development.\n\nOpposition: Argues domestic systems more effective at driving innovation due to localized incentives.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Proposition's argument more systemic and forward-looking\n- Opposition lacks evidence of national systems driving cross-border innovation\n- Unified approach better positioned for large-scale technological transformation\n- Winner: Proposition\n\nClash 3: Political Accountability\n\nProposition: Argues unified market creates collective accountability and removes ability to shirk responsibilities.\n\nOpposition: Claims domestic systems have greater political buy-in and local oversight is more effective.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Proposition's framework addresses global collective action problem\n- Opposition's examples don't demonstrate ability to coordinate international efforts\n- Unified approach better for tackling global challenge\n- Winner: Proposition\n\n2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\nProposition's core arguments:\n- Unity eliminates regulatory arbitrage and leakage\n- Creates stronger green innovation incentives\n- Enhances transparency and accountability\n\n- All link directly to systemic, global-level benefits\n- Address root causes of current inefficiencies\n- Highly impactful if true\n\nOpposition's core arguments:\n- National systems more adaptable\n- Risk of regulatory arbitrage in unified system\n- Domestic systems have greater political buy-in\n\n- While sound individually, don't address global nature of challenge\n- Less systemic impact\n\n3. Consistency and Contradictions\n\nNo major internal contradictions from either side. \nProposition effectively counters Opposition's concerns about arbitrage and accountability.\nOpposition fails to fully address Proposition's systemic arguments.\n\nII. Evaluation Requirements\n\nSteelmanning: Both sides presented maximum strength arguments.\nArgument-Based Decision: Analysis based solely on provided arguments.\nPresentation Ignored: Focused only on substance.\nFramework Neutrality: Evaluated each framework fairly.\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors\n\nAvoided intervention, shifting burden of proof, over-reliance on real-world arguments, ignoring dropped arguments, double-counting, assuming causation from correlation, and provided explicit clash decisions.\n\nIV. Decision Making\n\nKey Factors:\n1. Systemic nature of Proposition's approach better addresses global challenge\n2. EU ETS evidence demonstrates scalability and effectiveness\n3. Unified framework addresses root causes of current inefficiencies\n\nThese factors were decisive because they directly address the core requirements for tackling a global issue like climate change.\n\nAnalysis shows Proposition consistently won the key clashes by providing more comprehensive, systemic arguments backed by compelling evidence. Their framework better addresses the global nature of the challenge and provides clear mechanisms to overcome current inefficiencies.\n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>78</confidence>\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification\n\nProp 1: Presented three strong core arguments with solid evidence and clear connections.\nOpp 1: Countered with national examples but lacked global perspective.\nProp Rebuttal: Effectively addressed Opposition's points while reinforcing own arguments.\nOpp Rebuttal: Made valid critiques but failed to fully counter Proposition's systemic arguments.\nProp Final: Synthesized arguments compellingly, emphasizing global necessity.\nOpp Final: Continued focusing on national successes without addressing global coordination needs."

      "logic": "<winnerName>opposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>60</confidence>\n\n**I. Core Judging Principles**\n\n**I.1 Direct Clash Resolution**\n\n**Clash 1: Effectiveness of Carbon Reduction Mechanisms**\n- **Proposition**: \"EU ETS reduced emissions by 3.8% annually; localized systems cause carbon leakage.\"\n- **Opposition**: \"Sweden (28% reduction since 1991) and France (16% in 2 years) show national policies are more effective.\"\n  - *Analysis*: Opposition cites *specific, verifiable evidence* (Sweden/France), while Proposition\u2019s EU ETS data is regionally limited and lacks global applicability. Opposition argues localized systems prevent leakage, but Proposition counters that leakage *exists precisely because* of fragmented systems. However, Opposition\u2019s examples demonstrate *higher impact* in per-nation results. Proposition\u2019s rebuttal fails to explain why Sweden\u2019s approach wouldn\u2019t be replicated nationally under a unified framework. \n  - **Winner**: **Opposition**. Sweden\u2019s exceptional reduction rates weaken Proposition\u2019s claim that a fragmented system is inherently flawed. Proposition\u2019s argument about leakage is logically valid but undermined by the Opposition\u2019s evidence of localized success despite leakage risks. \n\n**Clash 2: Regulatory Arbitrage and Market Transparency**\n- **Proposition**: \"Quarterly auctions prevent arbitrage via transparency and global oversight.\"\n- **Opposition**: \"EU ETS faced manipulation; domestic oversight is more effective.\"\n  - *Analysis*: Opposition cites *specific critiques* of EU auctions (e.g., insufficient oversight) and valid evidence of localized accountability (France). Proposition\u2019s rebuttal claims preemptively addressed flaws but provides no evidence that *its specific system* solves EU\u2019s issues. Opposition\u2019s argument highlights systemic risks in scaling EU\u2019s model globally. \n  - **Winner**: **Opposition**. Proposition\u2019s rebuttal relies on theoretical safeguards with no evidence of effectiveness, whereas Opposition provides empirical criticism of similar systems.\n\n**Clash 3: Political Accountability**\n- **Proposition**: \"Collective accountability enhances enforcement.\"\n- **Opposition**: \"Domestic ownership prevents Kyoto-like failures; Norway/Denmark\u2019s success rests on local support.\"\n  - *Analysis*: Opposition cites the *Kyoto Protocol\u2019s failure due to lack of binding mechanisms*, directly countering Proposition\u2019s claim that global accountability works. Proposition does not address this key rebuttal, instead arguing participation removes evasion. Opposition\u2019s evidence of Norway/Denmark\u2019s sustained reductions due to local policies undercuts Proposition\u2019s assertion. \n  - **Winner**: **Opposition**. Domestic accountability\u2019s specificity (e.g., political support in Denmark) outweighs Proposition\u2019s vague claims about collective responsibility. \n\n**I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact**\n\n- **Proposition\u2019s Core Argument**: Unified markets address systemic leakage and innovation gaps. \n  - *Impact*: Potentially large but relies on unproven global scalability of EU\u2019s model. \n- **Opposition\u2019s Core Argument**: Local solutions like Sweden/France are adaptive and politically sustainable. \n  - *Impact*: Demonstrably effective in real-world contexts. \n\n**Weighing**: Opposition\u2019s arguments are more empirically grounded. Proposition\u2019s claims rest on theoretical frameworks with weaker evidence.\n\n**I.3 Consistency and Contradictions**\n\n- **Opposition**: Consistent in emphasizing localized adaptability. No contradictions.\n- **Proposition**: Fails to address Kyoto Protocol critique (a dropped argument)\u2014an important internal consistency flaw. \n\n---\n\n**II. Evaluation Requirements**\n\n- **Steelman**: Both sides\u2019 strongest arguments considered. \n- **Consistency**: No buried assumptions introduced. \n\n---\n\n**III. Common Errors Avoided**\n\n- **Over-reliance on \u201creal-world\u201d**: Both sides provided evidence-based claims. \n- **Double-counting**: No overlapping arguments. \n\n---\n\n**IV. Decision Making**\n\n**Winner**: Opposition (confidence: 60/100: **Narrow Victory**)  \n*(reasons below)*  \n\n**Key Factors**:  \n1. **Sweden/France Success**: Opposition\u2019s strong, specific evidence of localized effectiveness.  \n2. **Kyoto Protocol Failure**: Proposition dropped a critical rebuttal, weakening its global accountability claim.  \n3. **Transparency of Auctions**: Opposition\u2019s critique of EU ETS\u2019s flaws outweighed Proposition\u2019s claims about auctions.  \n\n**Detailed Reasoning**:  \n- Opposition\u2019s localized examples (Sweden\u2019s 28% reduction, France\u2019s efficiency) directly undermine Proposition\u2019s assertion that unified markets are inherently superior. \n- The EU\u2019s 3.8% regional improvement is modest and not clearly replicable on a global scale. \n- Proposition\u2019s lack of response to Kyoto\u2019s accountability failure leaves a critical hole in its argument. \n- Opposition logically tied systemic risks (e.g., arbitrage via auctions) to a unified market\u2019s potential for overlooking localized governance strengths. \n\n---\n\n**V. Line-by-Line Justification**\n\n- **Prop Opening**: Acknowledged EU ETS data and leakage concerns but failed to rebut Sweden\u2019s example. \n- **Opp Opening**: Used Sweden/France examples and Kyoto critique effectively. \n- **Prop Rebuttal**: Counter-argued leakage and market mechanisms but lacked specificity on EU flaws. \n- **Opp Rebuttal**: Highlighted EU\u2019s auction issues and countered innovation claims with Denmark/Norway\u2019s success. \n- **Prop Final**: Reinforced EU model efficacy but did not resolve Kyoto accountability gap. \n- **Opp Final**: Strengthened localized ownership argument by tying to political buy-in examples.  \n\nAll arguments addressed; Opposition\u2019s evidence-based critiques proved decisive."
