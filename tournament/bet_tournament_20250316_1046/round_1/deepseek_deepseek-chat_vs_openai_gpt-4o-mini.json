    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Professors have a moral duty to use their expertise for societal improvement through public advocacy.  \nSupport Type: Principle  \nSupport Details:  \nThe principle of academic social responsibility dictates that scholars must apply their knowledge for the greater good of society. This is rooted in the historical role of universities as institutions of enlightenment and social progress.  \nConnection: Given this moral imperative, professors should actively engage in public advocacy to fulfill their societal obligations and contribute to meaningful change within their fields.  \n\nARGUMENT 2  \nCore Claim: Public advocacy enhances the relevance and impact of academic expertise.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details:  \nFor example, Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s public advocacy during the COVID-19 pandemic shaped public health policies and saved countless lives. Similarly, Professor Naomi Oreskes\u2019s advocacy on climate change has influenced global environmental policies.  \nConnection: These cases demonstrate that when professors advocate publicly, their expertise becomes accessible and actionable, leading to tangible societal benefits.  \n\nARGUMENT 3  \nCore Claim: Public safeguards exist to ensure professors\u2019 advocacy remains credible and non-partisan.  \nSupport Type: Principle  \nSupport Details:  \nUniversities and professional bodies enforce strict ethical guidelines that prevent misuse of academic authority. These include peer review, institutional oversight, and mechanisms to address conflicts of interest.  \nConnection: These safeguards ensure that professors\u2019 advocacy remains rooted in evidence and expertise, mitigating concerns about bias or overreach.  \n\nSYNTHESIS  \nThese arguments work together to establish that professors have both a moral duty and a practical imperative to engage in public advocacy. By doing so, they fulfill their societal role, amplify the impact of their expertise, and adhere to professional safeguards that maintain credibility. This proposition not only aligns with historical academic traditions but also addresses pressing societal needs by making specialized knowledge accessible to the public.  \n\n",
      "rebuttal": "### REBUTTAL STRUCTURE\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Professors, as experts in their fields, have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy to inform and educate society on critical social and political issues.\"  \nChallenge Type: **Counter Principle**  \nChallenge:  \nWhile the opposition claims that professors have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy, this principle overlooks the **potential harm of conflating academic expertise with advocacy**. The core role of professors is to provide objective, evidence-based analysis, not to advocate for specific political or social positions. When professors engage in advocacy, they risk undermining the perceived neutrality of academia, which is crucial for maintaining public trust. A superior principle is **academic neutrality**, which emphasizes the importance of professors providing unbiased information to the public without taking a stance. This allows individuals to form their own conclusions rather than being influenced by potentially partisan advocacy.  \nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it challenges the foundational premise of the opposition\u2019s case. If professors\u2019 primary role is to remain neutral, the moral obligation for advocacy collapses, weakening their entire argument.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Active engagement by professors in public advocacy can lead to significant societal impact and policy change.\"  \nChallenge Type: **Evidence Critique**  \nChallenge:  \nThe opposition cites examples like Angela Davis and COVID-19 experts to claim that advocacy leads to significant societal impact. However, these examples are **cherry-picked and not representative of the broader reality**. For every successful case of advocacy, there are instances where professors\u2019 advocacy has backfired, leading to public skepticism or policy failures. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, some public health experts advocated for policies like lockdowns, which, while well-intentioned, had unintended consequences such as economic downturns and mental health crises. This shows that advocacy can lead to **imperfect or harmful outcomes** when the full complexity of issues is not considered. Furthermore, the Stanford study cited by the opposition does not account for the potential negative externalities of advocacy, such as politicization of academic work.  \nImpact: This critique exposes the limitations of the opposition\u2019s evidence, showing that advocacy is not uniformly beneficial and can sometimes cause harm, which undermines their case.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Public advocacy by professors can enhance the credibility of research and academia in society.\"  \nChallenge Type: **Counter Evidence**  \nChallenge:  \nWhile the opposition claims that advocacy increases public trust, there is strong evidence to the contrary. A 2020 study published in *Nature* found that when academics engage in advocacy, it often leads to **decreased trust in their findings** because the public perceives them as biased or partisan. For example, in the climate change debate, some professors\u2019 advocacy has been met with skepticism, particularly from groups who view their positions as politically motivated. This polarization can erode the credibility of academic institutions rather than enhance it. Instead of advocacy, **transparent dissemination of research** without taking a stance is more effective in building public trust.  \nImpact: This counterevidence directly challenges the opposition\u2019s claim, showing that advocacy can harm the credibility of academia rather than strengthen it.\n\n---\n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n1. The opposition may argue that academic neutrality is unrealistic or that professors cannot remain entirely unbiased.  \n2. They may attempt to downplay the negative externalities of advocacy by focusing only on successful examples.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n1. Studies show that perceived neutrality is critical for public trust in academia (Pew Research, 2021).  \n2. Examples of advocacy failures, such as the controversy surrounding the 2016 letter by economists supporting the Brexit referendum, demonstrate the risks of mixing advocacy with academic expertise.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur arguments are grounded in principle (academic neutrality) and supported by strong evidence that counters the opposition\u2019s claims. We acknowledge the potential benefits of advocacy but show why the risks outweigh them, making our case more compelling.\n\n---\n\n### WEIGHING  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. The moral obligation of professors: Our counter principle of academic neutrality is superior to their advocacy mandate.  \n2. The societal impact of advocacy: Our evidence critique shows that advocacy is not consistently beneficial and can cause harm.  \n3. The credibility of academia: Our counterevidence demonstrates that advocacy can erode public trust.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \nWe have effectively dismantled the opposition\u2019s arguments by challenging their principles, critiquing their evidence, and providing superior counterarguments. Our case remains consistent and logically sound.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nBy showing that advocacy risks undermining academic neutrality and credibility, we prove that the motion is not justified and that professors should prioritize their role as objective experts rather than advocates.\n\n### BET\n",
      "closing": "### FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\n---\n\n#### FRAMING  \n**Core Questions:**  \nThe fundamental issue in this debate is whether professors should prioritize academic neutrality or public advocacy in their professional roles. The key decisions revolve around understanding the purpose of academia and the societal impact of professors\u2019 engagement.  \n\n**How Debate Should Be Evaluated:**  \nThis debate should be evaluated based on two criteria:  \n1. **Academic Integrity:** Does public advocacy enhance or compromise the credibility and objectivity of academia?  \n2. **Societal Impact:** Does advocacy by professors lead to meaningful societal benefits, or does it risk causing harm through unintended consequences?  \n\n---\n\n#### KEY CLASHES  \n\n**CLASH 1: Moral Obligation vs. Academic Neutrality**  \n**Quote:** \"Professors, as experts in their fields, have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy to inform and educate society on critical social and political issues.\" vs. \"The core role of professors is to provide objective, evidence-based analysis, not to advocate for specific political or social positions.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The principle of academic neutrality is superior because it ensures that professors remain trusted sources of unbiased information. Studies from Pew Research (2021) show that public trust in academia is highest when professors are perceived as neutral.  \n- Advocacy risks conflating personal opinions with expert knowledge, undermining the credibility of academic institutions.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition fails to address the risks of advocacy leading to public skepticism or polarization.  \n- They rely on emotional appeals (e.g., Angela Davis) rather than providing systematic evidence that advocacy is universally beneficial.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash matters because it defines the role of professors in society. If advocacy compromises academic neutrality, it erodes public trust, which is foundational to the legitimacy of academia.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH 2: Public Advocacy as a Catalyst for Policy Change**  \n**Quote:** \"Active engagement by professors in public advocacy can lead to significant societal impact and policy change.\" vs. \"Advocacy is not consistently beneficial and can cause harm when the full complexity of issues is not considered.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Examples like the COVID-19 lockdowns show that advocacy can lead to unintended negative consequences, such as economic downturns and mental health crises.  \n- The Stanford study cited by the opposition does not account for the broader risks of politicizing academic work.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- They cherry-pick success stories without addressing the systemic risks of advocacy.  \n- They fail to provide evidence that advocacy consistently leads to positive outcomes.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is critical because it determines whether advocacy is a reliable tool for societal improvement. If advocacy often backfires, it undermines the practical justification for the motion.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH 3: Credibility of Academia**  \n**Quote:** \"Public advocacy by professors can enhance the credibility of research and academia in society.\" vs. \"When academics engage in advocacy, it often leads to decreased trust in their findings because the public perceives them as biased or partisan.\"  \n\n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- A 2020 *Nature* study shows that advocacy decreases public trust in academic findings when it is perceived as politically motivated.  \n- Transparent dissemination of research without advocacy is more effective in building public trust.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s evidence (AAUP report) does not address the risks of polarization and skepticism that advocacy can create.  \n- They fail to recognize that neutrality, not advocacy, is the foundation of academic credibility.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is decisive because it determines whether advocacy strengthens or weakens the role of academia in society. If advocacy erodes trust, it undermines the very purpose of academic institutions.  \n\n---\n\n#### VOTING ISSUES  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most important clash is **academic neutrality vs. advocacy**, as it defines the core role of professors and the legitimacy of academia. The other clashes build on this foundation, showing the risks and limitations of advocacy.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning the neutrality vs. advocacy clash proves our case because it shows that the primary role of professors is to provide objective expertise, not to advocate for specific positions. The other clashes reinforce this by demonstrating the risks of advocacy and its potential to harm academic credibility and societal trust.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nEven if the opposition wins minor points (e.g., cherry-picked examples of successful advocacy), these do not outweigh the fundamental importance of academic neutrality. The risks of advocacy\u2014eroding trust, causing unintended harm, and politicizing academia\u2014far outweigh any potential benefits.  \n\n---\n\n**Why You Should Vote Proposition:**  \nOur case is grounded in the principle of academic neutrality, which is essential for maintaining public trust in academia. We have systematically dismantled the opposition\u2019s arguments by showing the risks and limitations of advocacy. The societal impact of advocacy is inconsistent and often harmful, while neutrality ensures that professors can fulfill their role as trusted experts.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nBy prioritizing academic neutrality, we preserve the integrity and credibility of academia, ensuring that it remains a trusted source of knowledge in an increasingly polarized world. This is far more valuable than the uncertain and often risky benefits of advocacy.\n\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Professors, as experts in their fields, have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy to inform and educate society on critical social and political issues.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details: The role of educators extends beyond the classroom; they are seen as thought leaders and must contribute to critical public discourse. The principle of the \u201cpublic intellectual\u201d is crucial as it holds that scholars should use their expertise to address societal challenges. Engaging in advocacy allows professors to provide the public with informed perspectives grounded in research, thus enhancing democratic dialogue.  \nConnection: This principle illustrates why professors have not only the right but the responsibility to speak out on vital issues, making my claim clear: their involvement is essential to foster well-informed citizens and energetic civic participation.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Active engagement by professors in public advocacy can lead to significant societal impact and policy change.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details: Historically, professors such as Angela Davis, a leader in the civil rights movement, have utilized their platforms to advocate for social justice, resulting in heightened awareness and legislative change. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many professors in public health used their expertise to advocate for science-based policy measures, which directly influenced government responses worldwide, such as mask mandates and vaccination campaigns that saved countless lives. According to a 2021 study from Stanford University, engagement of academic experts in policy discussions resulted in more effective communication of scientific findings and accelerated the implementation of health measures.  \nConnection: These examples demonstrate that when professors advocate for social and political issues, their influence can bring about substantial change in public policy and community health, reinforcing the importance of their role in advocacy.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors can enhance the credibility of research and academia in society.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details: A report from the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) reveals that public engagement by academics increases public trust in scientific and academic institutions. For instance, during the climate change debate, professors who actively engaged the public through advocacy helped bridge the gap between scientific understanding and public perception, contributing to a 15% increase in public trust as measured by surveys in regions where advocacy was high. The advocacy efforts also led to greater funding for research projects aimed at addressing climate change.  \nConnection: By participating in public advocacy, professors enhance the legitimacy of their research and the overall importance of academia, thus demonstrating why their involvement is necessary.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe arguments presented collectively illustrate that professors engaging in public advocacy serves crucial societal needs: it fulfills a moral obligation, facilitates public policy change, and bolsters the credibility of academia. Together, these points present a unified case for the motion, demonstrating that the involvement of professors in social and political advocacy is not only beneficial but essential for promoting informed public discourse and effecting positive change in society.\n\nIn conclusion, engaging in public advocacy allows professors to use their expertise for the greater good and addresses the pressing challenges faced within society today.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Professors, as experts in their fields, have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy to inform and educate society on critical social and political issues.\"  \nChallenge Type: Principle Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- While the \"public intellectual\" principle asserts that scholars should use their expertise to engage with social issues, it overlooks the complexity of academic neutrality. Engaging in advocacy can compromise the objectivity that is essential in creating unbiased research and academic discourse, thus leading to a potential erosion of trust in academia.\n- Furthermore, the idea that professors must engage in public advocacy risks conflating their expert knowledge with personal opinions. This can dilute the integrity of their research and transform their authoritative voice into one of partisanship, which counteracts the very essence of scholarly debate \u2014 the pursuit of truth unaffected by bias.\n\n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial as it emphasizes the need for academic neutrality and the potential dangers of infringing upon the role of scholars in society. It articulates that maintaining an unbiased position ultimately serves to safeguard the integrity of academic knowledge.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Active engagement by professors in public advocacy can lead to significant societal impact and policy change.\"  \nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- Although historical examples like Angela Davis and public health experts during COVID-19 suggest a positive influence, such cases are not universally applicable. For instance, there are significant instances where professors\u2019 advocacy has been contested or led to misinformation.\n- Furthermore, evidence indicates that scholars may not always effectively translate their expertise into impactful public dialogue. A meta-analysis conducted by the National Academies of Sciences reveals that while experts see themselves as credible advocates, their engagement often lacks significant public follow-through or understanding, limiting the actual implementation of their proposed policies.\n\n**Impact:** This point is vital as it challenges the assertion that advocacy equates to effective policy change. Without substantial evidence of advocacy translating into action consistently, the argument for professors' engagement in public discourse falters.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Public advocacy by professors can enhance the credibility of research and academia in society.\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence  \nChallenge:  \n- Contrary to the assertion, evidence from recent studies (2022 report from the Pew Research Center) indicates that excessive public advocacy by scholars can lead to decreased trust in scientific institutions when the public perceives bias. This demonstrates a correlation between heightened advocacy and skepticism towards academia, particularly when public narratives diverge from scientific consensus.\n- Furthermore, other qualitative research indicates that public trust is maintained primarily through perceived objectivity and scholarly detachment from political agendas. Advocacy that is perceived as politically motivated often incites backlash, resulting in diminished confidence in both the messenger and the message.\n\n**Impact:** Winning this point reinforces the idea that credibility thrives on perceived impartiality rather than advocacy. This realization is pivotal in a debate centered on the expectations of scholars and the societal trust placed in academic expertise.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \nVulnerabilities:  \n- The potential counter-argument could state that advocacy builds bridges between academia and society.  \n- Another weakness might be the perceived lack of passion and urgency in my arguments compared to emotional narratives of public advocacy.  \n\nAdditional Support:  \n- To fortify my stance, I highlight research studies conducted by the American Scientific Affiliation, suggesting that scientists who remain neutral are often seen as more trustworthy.  \n- I can also counter the opposition's emphasis on passion by showing that professionalism and integrity in academia are crucial for long-term societal benefit.  \n\nWhy We Prevail:  \n- There is a marked contrast between my arguments emphasizing the importance of academic neutrality and the opposition\u2019s advocacy-focused framework that risks compromising the integrity of research. \n- My responses are rooted in evidence that substantiates the flaws in the role of advocacy, thereby yielding a stronger rationale for my position.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \nKey Clash Points:  \n- The most important disagreement lies in the implications of professors\u2019 engagement in advocacy and its effects on academic credibility and integrity, as well as the effectiveness of such advocacy in impacting policy.  \n- The consequences of public advocacy compromising academic objectivity resonate strongly throughout the debate.\n\nWhy We Win:  \n- By demonstrating the potential pitfalls of advocacy, I stronger align my case with the larger mission of academia, calling for humility and caution from scholars in their pursuits. \n- This framing shifts the focus from qualitative anecdotes in favor of rigorously supportable claims about trust, objectivity, and preservation of academic values.\n\nOverall Impact:  \n- Winning these key points highlights the tension between advocacy and the foundational principles of academia. As we navigate crucial societal challenges, it becomes evident that maintaining the integrity of knowledge is paramount for fostering genuine social progress.\n\n",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nCore Questions:  \n- The fundamental issue in this debate revolves around the role of professors: should they engage in public advocacy, or should they prioritize academic neutrality?  \n- The key decision is whether the potential benefits of advocacy outweigh the risks of undermining academic objectivity and public trust.  \n- This debate should be evaluated on the basis of principles of academic integrity, the effectiveness of advocacy in creating positive societal change, and the overall impact on public trust in academia.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**Clash Point 1:**  \nQuote: \"Professors have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy to inform and educate society on critical social and political issues.\"  \nOur Case Strength:  \n- We have established a principle of academic neutrality which insists that professors should provide unbiased, evidence-based analysis rather than engage in specific advocacy. This upholds the integrity of their research and the credibility of academia.  \n- Evidence from the 2022 Pew Research Center study indicates that public trust in scholars diminishes when advocacy is viewed as politically biased, demonstrating that the opposition's moral argument weakens the perceived authority of professors.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n- The opposition has failed to adequately address the consequences of conflating their expertise with advocacy. They overlook how advocacy can dilute the objective stance that is essential in academia.  \n- By ignoring the potential harm of advocacy on public trust, they miss a critical angle in their argument.  \n\nCrucial Impact:  \n- This clash matters because it exposes the potential danger of advocacy, which can confuse the public about the role of experts and lead to skepticism of academia, ultimately detracting from informed public discourse.\n\n**Clash Point 2:**  \nQuote: \"Active engagement by professors in public advocacy can lead to significant societal impact and policy change.\"  \nOur Case Strength:  \n- Our critique highlights that examples of advocacy do not universally lead to positive outcomes. Notably, while Angela Davis is a success story, public health experts during COVID-19 faced backlash over contentious policies, indicating that advocacy can lead to unintended negative consequences.  \n- Evidence from the National Academies of Sciences reveals that while professors may feel they are credible advocates, the public does not necessarily translate that to effective policy dialogue, which undermines the reliability of advocacy as a means to effect change.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n- They have not thoroughly addressed the potential harms of advocacy, focusing instead on successful anecdotes without acknowledging instances of advocacy failures.  \n- Furthermore, they failed to engage with the substantial evidence that suggests professors' engagement does not always result in meaningful public understanding or policy follow-through.\n\nCrucial Impact:  \n- Demonstrating that advocacy can sometimes lead to misinformation and a failure to effect significant change emphasizes the risks in the opposition's arguments and questions their assumption that advocacy is inherently beneficial.\n\n**Clash Point 3:**  \nQuote: \"Public advocacy by professors can enhance the credibility of research and academia in society.\"  \nOur Case Strength:  \n- We have shown that excessive advocacy often leads to decreased credibility among academics, as supported by the research from the American Scientific Affiliation. This counters the idea that advocacy fosters trust, highlighting the importance of perceived neutrality.  \n- Evidence indicates that when professors are seen advocating politically, it generally incites skepticism from the public and can polarize the discourse, thus damaging the reputation of scientific institutions.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n- The opposition has not effectively countered our evidence that public perception of bias can erode trust in research and institutions.  \n- Their narrative fails to recognize that trust is built through objectivity, and they have not convincingly demonstrated that advocacy leads to greater credibility.\n\nCrucial Impact:  \n- This clash matters because it speaks to the foundational role of academia in society. Maintaining academic integrity is essential for fostering trust in research and scholarly work, which is crucial for addressing societal challenges.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\nPriority Analysis:  \n- The most significant clashes that matter revolve around academic neutrality, the effectiveness of advocacy in leading to impactful policy change, and how advocacy affects public trust in academia.  \n- We believe our arguments show that advocacy undermines the credibility of academia and does not consistently lead to positive societal impacts, making our side stronger.\n\nCase Proof:  \n- Winning these key points supports our case by establishing that the risks of advocacy far outweigh potential benefits. We show that professors\u2019 primary role should be to maintain objectivity and integrity in their research to truly benefit society.  \n- Our logical chain demonstrates that advocacy can indeed lead to confusion and distrust, thereby detracting from the impact that professors can have in their fields.\n\nFinal Weighing:  \n- While both sides presented arguments, we have effectively challenged the core tenets of the opposition's position. Our emphasis on the necessity of academic neutrality, along with compelling evidence regarding the risks of advocacy, offers a stronger foundation for our stance.  \n- The overall importance of maintaining academic credibility and integrity significantly outweighs the points raised by the opposition concerning the potential benefits of advocacy. Thus, a responsible view of professors' roles should prioritize objectivity over personal engagement in advocacy.\n\nIn conclusion, we have successfully articulated the case that professors should not engage in public advocacy on social and political issues due to the risks associated with undermining academic credibility and the potential for advocacy to lead to public misinformation.  \n\n"

The Proposition argued against public advocacy by professors, emphasizing academic neutrality and potential harms from advocacy. The Opposition defended advocacy, citing principles of public intellectuals and evidence of societal benefit. While the Proposition provided studies on trust and risks of advocacy, the Opposition\u2019s arguments were stronger in addressing key galoshes and maintaining a balanced view. The following analysis elaborates:\n\n1. **Clash 1 (Moral Obligation vs. Neutrality):**  \n   - **Proposition Claim:** Academic neutrality is morally superior because advocacy risks bias and harms trust (Pew 2021 study).  \n   - **Opposition Claim:** Professors have a moral duty to contribute to public discourse as thought leaders.  \n   - **Analysis:** While Proposition cited specific studies on trust, the Opposition successfully framed advocacy as an extension of academic responsibility without necessarily forcing bias. The ethical obligation to engage is compelling, and the Proposition\u2019s focus on neutrality overlooked societal need for informed advocacy.  \n\n2. **Clash 2 (Societal Impact):**  \n   - **Opposition Evidence:** Examples like Angela Davis and pandemic responses showed tangible policy impacts.  \n   - **Proposition Critique:** Argued cherry-picking and negative outcomes (e.g., lockdowns) without counterevidence linking advocacy directly to harm.  \n   - **Analysis:** The Opposition provided concrete examples, while Proposition\u2019s critique lacked systematic evidence. Public advocacy\u2019s positive outcomes outweighed hypothetical risks.  \n\n3. **Clash 3 (Credibility):**  \n   - **Proposition Claim:** Advocacy decreases trust (Nature study 2020).  \n   - **Opposition Claim:** Advocacy increases credibility (AAUP report).  \n   - **Analysis:** The studies were conflicting, but the Opposition\u2019s emphasis on transparency in advocacy (e.g., climate policy bridging gaps) better addressed polarization compared to Proposition\u2019s vague neutrality argument.  \n\n**Key Factors:**  \n- **Balance between Principle and Evidence:** The Opposition blended ethical principles with practical examples effectively. The Proposition failed to prove that advocacy inherently harms trust or integrity beyond isolated cases.  \n- **Societal Relevance:** Advocacy serves as a bridge between academia and society, a point undervalued by the Proposition.  \n\n**Confidence Level:** 55 (Narrow Victory). The debate was closely contested, but the Opposition\u2019s practical examples and ethical framing edged them ahead. The Proposition\u2019s dependency on narrow studies and inability to fully counter success stories weakened their position.  \n\n**Detailed Reasoning:** The Opposition\u2019s synthesis of moral duty, societal impact, and trust\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 (enhancement of trust) formed a consistent case. The Proposition\u2019s counterarguments, while logical, were overly focused on worst-case scenarios and didn\u2019t negate the value of advocacy in driving progress. The AAUP/Pew studies were balanced by real-world outcomes, making advocacy\u2019s benefits more tangible."

Direct Clash Resolution:\n\nClash 1: Moral Obligation to Advocate vs. Academic Neutrality\n\n* Proposition: \"The core role of professors is to provide objective, evidence-based analysis, not to advocate for specific political or social positions. When professors engage in advocacy, they risk undermining the perceived neutrality of academia, which is crucial for maintaining public trust.\"\n* Opposition: \"Professors, as experts in their fields, have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy to inform and educate society on critical social and political issues....  Engaging in advocacy allows professors to provide the public with informed perspectives grounded in research, thus enhancing democratic dialogue.\"\n\nLogic & Evidence:  Both sides present valid principles. Proposition supports academic neutrality with evidence from Pew Research (2021) showing higher public trust when professors are perceived as neutral. Opposition's argument about enhancing democratic dialogue is reasonable but lacks specific evidence.  Opposition initially relies on the principle of the \"public intellectual,\" but this is later reframed as academic neutrality, which concedes ground to the proposition.\n\nRebuttals: Proposition effectively challenges the Opposition's position by highlighting the risk of conflating expertise with personal opinions and undermining objectivity. The Opposition\u2019s rebuttal  focuses more on defending against the critique than providing strong counter-arguments.\n\nWinner: Proposition. While both sides present valid arguments, Proposition's argument is strengthened by evidence of increased public trust through neutrality, and their rebuttal directly addresses the Opposition\u2019s point about the potential dangers of advocacy.\n\nClash 2: Societal Impact of Advocacy\n\n* Proposition: \"Advocacy is not consistently beneficial and can cause harm when the full complexity of issues is not considered...Examples like the COVID-19 lockdowns show that advocacy can lead to unintended negative consequences, such as economic downturns and mental health crises.\"\n* Opposition: \"Active engagement by professors in public advocacy can lead to significant societal impact and policy change...Historically, professors such as Angela Davis...and...COVID-19 pandemic...demonstrate that when professors advocate for social and political issues, their influence can bring about substantial change.\"\n\nLogic & Evidence:  Proposition provides a stronger argument by acknowledging potential negative consequences and citing specific examples like the COVID-19 lockdowns. Opposition uses examples like Angela Davis and COVID-19 experts, but these are anecdotal and don't prove a consistent positive impact. The Opposition's cited Stanford study is critiqued by the Proposition for not considering negative externalities, a criticism not addressed by the Opposition.\n\nRebuttals:  Proposition effectively critiques the Opposition's evidence, while Opposition fails to effectively address the potential negative consequences raised by Proposition.  The Opposition\u2019s attempt at rebuttal involves claiming similar counter-examples exist without providing specific evidence.\n\nWinner: Proposition. They successfully undermine the Opposition's examples and offer stronger evidence of potential harm, while the Opposition fails to effectively defend its position or provide consistent evidence of positive impact.\n\nClash 3: Advocacy and Academic Credibility\n\n* Proposition: \"When academics engage in advocacy, it often leads to decreased trust in their findings because the public perceives them as biased or partisan...A 2020 study published in *Nature* found that when academics engage in advocacy, it often leads to decreased trust in their findings.\"\n* Opposition: \"Public advocacy by professors can enhance the credibility of research and academia in society...A report from the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) reveals that public engagement by academics increases public trust.\"\n\nLogic & Evidence:  Both sides offer evidence, but Proposition's *Nature* study is more specific and relevant to the question of trust in findings after advocacy. Opposition initially cites an AAUP report but later shifts to a Pew Research Center study and introduces a new argument focusing on the perception of neutrality and objective engagement, potentially undermining their initial advocacy position.  Proposition, on the other hand, remains internally more consistent.\n\nRebuttals: Proposition challenges the relevance of Opposition\u2019s evidence. The Opposition does not successfully counter Proposition\u2019s argument, focusing on citing other sources without specifically addressing the argument regarding perceived neutrality.\n\nWinner: Proposition.  Their *Nature* study directly addresses the issue of public trust after advocacy while Opposition's evidence is less specific and more readily undermined. \n\nI.2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact:\n\nProposition\u2019s Core Argument:  Academic neutrality is essential for maintaining public trust and the integrity of academia. Supporting arguments demonstrate the potential harms of advocacy, making neutrality the superior principle. The impact of this argument is maintaining the credibility of academic institutions and ensuring their continued relevance in society.\n\nOpposition's Core Argument: Professors have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy to inform society and effect positive change. Supporting arguments claim advocacy leads to societal impact and enhances academic credibility. The impact is achieving positive social and political change informed by expert knowledge.\n\nRelative Importance: The clash over academic neutrality vs. advocacy is most central. It determines the fundamental role of professors and frames the other arguments regarding societal impact and credibility.\n\nI.3. Weighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments:\n\nProposition effectively balances its principled argument (academic neutrality) with practical concerns (negative consequences of advocacy).  Opposition's practical arguments (positive impact of advocacy) are undermined by lack of specific evidence and failure to address potential negative consequences raised by Proposition.\n\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\n\nSteelmanning: I have presented both sides' arguments in their strongest form.\n\nArgument-Based Decision: This analysis is solely based on the arguments presented within the debate text.\n\nIgnore Presentation: Presentation style is not considered.\n\nFramework Neutrality: The analysis is based on the interaction of the arguments presented.\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:  All listed errors have been avoided.\n\nIV. Decision Making:\n\nWinner: Proposition\n\nConfidence Level: 75\n\nKey Factors:\n\n1. The clash between academic neutrality and advocacy is decisive. Proposition's strong defense of neutrality coupled with evidence of increased public trust associated with it is compelling.\n2. Proposition\u2019s successful dismantling of the core Opposition arguments regarding the purported benefits of advocacy through specific counter-examples and logical reasoning.\n3. The shifting nature of Opposition's arguments in their final rebuttal, particularly on the issue of academic credibility, signals a weakening of their advocacy position.\n\nDetailed Reasoning: Proposition's arguments carry more weight and demonstrate through logic and evidence that advocacy poses a serious threat to essential elements of and the fundamental role of academia in society, namely public trust, credibility, and objectivity.  Even if some successful examples of advocacy exist, the consistent risks of misrepresenting expertise, undermining public trust, and generating unintended negative consequences make the dangers of advocacy too high to justify the motion.\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\n\n* Prop 1:  Proposition establishes their core arguments for the moral duty, enhanced relevance, and safeguards of public advocacy.\n* Opp 1: Opposition presents their case for the moral obligation, societal impact, and credibility enhancement of professorial advocacy.\n* Prop Rebuttal 1: Proposition challenges Opposition's claims by raising the counter-principle of academic neutrality, critiquing their evidence, and presenting counter-evidence.\n* Opp Rebuttal 1: Opposition attempts to defend their position and offers some critiques, referencing additional sources without fully rebutting Proposition's points.\n* Prop Final: Proposition clarifies their framing, synthesizes the key clashes, reinforces their arguments, and explains why they should win based on academic integrity and societal impact.\n* Opp Final:  Opposition reframes some of their arguments by focusing on neutrality being paramount, reiterating slightly modified core positions, and summarizes the key clashes, ultimately arguing they better upheld academic integrity by prioritizing neutrality over advocacy. \n"

      "logic": "Here is my analysis of the debate:\n\nI. Core Judging Principles\n\n1. Direct Clash Resolution\n\nClash 1: Moral Obligation vs. Academic Neutrality\nProposition argues for academic neutrality, citing risks to public trust when professors engage in advocacy. Opposition claims professors have a moral duty to advocate. \nProposition wins this clash. Their principle of academic neutrality is stronger, supported by evidence from Pew Research showing higher public trust in neutral academics. The opposition fails to adequately address the risks of advocacy undermining trust.\n\nClash 2: Public Advocacy as a Catalyst for Policy Change  \nProposition critiques the opposition's evidence as cherry-picked, noting examples where advocacy backfired like COVID lockdowns. Opposition cites cases like Angela Davis and COVID experts.\nProposition wins this clash. They effectively show advocacy does not consistently lead to positive outcomes and can cause harm. The opposition's examples are not representative of the broader reality.\n\nClash 3: Credibility of Academia\nProposition argues advocacy decreases public trust, citing a 2020 Nature study. Opposition claims advocacy enhances credibility, referencing an AAUP report. \nProposition wins this clash. The Nature study directly counters the opposition's claim, showing advocacy can erode trust when perceived as biased. The AAUP report does not address this risk.\n\n2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\nThe core clash is academic neutrality vs. advocacy, as it defines the role of professors. Proposition's arguments on the risks of advocacy to neutrality and trust are most central to resolving the motion. The opposition's claims about the benefits of advocacy are secondary and insufficient to outweigh these risks.\n\n3. Consistency and Contradictions\n\nBoth sides remain consistent. No major dropped arguments or contradictions are present.\n\nII. Evaluation Requirements\n\nI have steelmanned both sides' arguments and based my analysis solely on the arguments made in the debate text, without introducing outside knowledge or opinions. I have maintained framework neutrality.\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\nI have avoided all the listed judging errors, including intervention, shifting the burden of proof, over-reliance on \"real-world\" arguments, ignoring dropped arguments, double-counting, assuming causation from correlation, and not justifying clash decisions.\n\nIV. Decision Making\n\nWinner: Proposition\nConfidence Level: 75 (Clear Victory)\n\nKey Factors:\n1. Proposition's principle of academic neutrality is superior to the opposition's moral obligation for advocacy, as it better preserves public trust.\n2. Proposition effectively critiques the opposition's evidence on the benefits of advocacy, showing it is not consistently positive and can cause harm.  \n3. Proposition provides strong counterevidence that advocacy can erode the credibility of academia rather than enhance it.\n\nDetailed Reasoning:\nProposition's case is grounded in the principle of academic neutrality, which is essential for maintaining public trust in academia. They systematically dismantle the opposition's arguments by showing the risks and limitations of advocacy. The societal impact of advocacy is inconsistent and often harmful, while neutrality ensures that professors can fulfill their role as trusted experts. The opposition's claims about the benefits of advocacy are insufficient to outweigh these risks. Therefore, Proposition has the stronger case.\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification\n\nProposition Opening Speech: Presents three strong arguments for academic neutrality and against advocacy, supported by principles and evidence.\n\nOpposition Opening Speech: Makes a case for professors' moral obligation to advocate, but the arguments are less robust than Proposition's.\n\nProposition Rebuttal: Effectively critiques the opposition's arguments, exposing flaws in their principles and evidence.\n\nOpposition Rebuttal: Attempts to defend their case but fails to adequately address Proposition's critiques.\n\nProposition Closing Speech: Strongly summarizes their case, emphasizing the importance of academic neutrality and the risks of advocacy.\n\nOpposition Closing Speech: Reiterates their arguments but does not overcome Proposition's superior case.\n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>75</confidence>"

It directly addresses the erosion of public trust when perceived bias arises from advocacy (Pew Research: 2021), linking neutrality to credibility directly. The **opposition\u2019s moral obligation argument relies on subjective anecdotes** (e.g., Angela Davis) without addressing systemic risks.  \n  - **Rebuttal Effectiveness:** Proposition explicitly tied advocacy to polarization risks, which Opposition did not counter\u2014attempts to frame advocacy as \u201cobjective\u201d in their rebuttal failed because it conflates advocacy with expertise.  \n  - **Winner:** Proposition. Neutral scholars maintain trust; cherry-picked moral examples are insufficient.  \n\n**Clash 2: Advocacy\u2019s Societal Benefits vs. Harms**  \n- **Proposition Challenge:** Advocacy risks harm (e.g., unintended consequences of lockdowns, Stanford study flaws).  \n- **Opposition Defense:** Advocacy drives policy (e.g., Fauci, Davis) and responds to crises.  \n- **Analysis:**  \n  - Proposition exposed **cherry-picking** in opposition\u2019s evidence and highlighted causal flaws (e.g., lockdowns caused economic harm). Opposition did not refute these critiques; their rebuttal acknowledged advocacy\u2019s \u201csystemic risks\u201d but did not counter Proposition\u2019s specific claims.  \n  - **Rebuttal Flaws:** Opposition\u2019s response to the effectiveness of advocacy relied on unverified claims about \u201cpassionate narratives,\u201d which lack specificity and refute the cited peer-reviewed studies.  \n  - **Winner:** Proposition. Advocacy\u2019s harms (e.g., unintended consequences) outweigh cherry-picked benefits, weakening opposition\u2019s practical argument.  \n\n**Clash 3: Advocacy\u2019s Impact on Credibility**  \n- **Proposition:** Advocacy erodes trust (*Nature* study: perceived bias lowers trust).  \n- **Opposition:** Advocacy boosts trust (AAUP report, climate change narratives).  \n- **Analysis:**  \n  - Proposition\u2019s evidence is **more direct and specific**\u2014*Nature* quantifies trust loss tied to advocacy. Opposition\u2019s AAUP report is vague on *how* trust increases, ignored polarization risks, and failed to address Pew\u2019s neutrality-correlation.  \n  - **Undermining Success:** Proposition explicitly argued that neutrality\u2014not advocacy\u2014is foundational for trust, a point Opposition did not refute.  \n  - **Winner:** Proposition. Direct evidence links advocacy to decreased trust, nullifying Opposition\u2019s credibility claim.  \n\n---\n\n**I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact**  \n- **Proposition\u2019s Core Argument:** Academic neutrality is **central to all three clashes**. It defines the professor\u2019s societal role, underpins the critique of advocacy\u2019s impracticality, and directly addresses credibility. Its impacts (trust, unbiased knowledge, long-term societal reliance on objective expertise) are global and foundational.  \n- **Opposition\u2019s Core Argument:** Moral duty via public advocacy ties to tangible policy changes, but its impacts depend on advocacy\u2019s reliability. This is **less central** because Proposition dismantled its feasibility and consequences.  \n\n**I.3 Consistency and Contradictions**  \n- **Opposition Vulnerability:** Their opening speech conflates \u201cpublic discourse\u201d with partisan advocacy but later tried to distance advocacy from partisanship in rebuttals\u2014**inconsistent framing of advocacy\u2019s neutrality**.  \n- **Proposition:** Consistent in framing neutrality as the pillar of academia, with no contradictions.  \n\n---\n\n**II. Evaluation Requirements**  \n- **Steelman:** Opposition\u2019s advocacy examples were charitably interpreted, but their failure to rebut neutrality critiques matters.  \n- **Argument-Based Decision:** No external assumptions used; relies solely on debate text.  \n\n---\n\n**III. Common Judging Errors Avoided**  \n- No causation-over-correlation bias\u2014explicitly evaluated evidence for causal links (e.g., locking attribution of trust loss solely to advocacy).  \n- Addressed all dropped arguments: Opposition\u2019s \u201cbridging academia-society gap\u201d claim was flimsily evidence and dropped by Proposition, which focused on neutrality instead.  \n\n---\n\n**IV. Decision Making**  \n**Winner:** **Proposition**.  \n**Confidence:** 75/100 (**Clear Victory**). Proposition won all key clashes, and the opposition failed to defend their core principle against neutrality critiques.  \n**Key Factors:**  \n1. **Neutrality vs. Advocacy Clash** (undermined all opposition claims).  \n2. **Credibility Impact** (*Nature* study versus vague opposition claims).  \n3. **Policy Effectiveness** (proposition\u2019s rebuttal exposed advocacy\u2019s systemic risks, nullifying opposition\u2019s cherry-picked evidence).  \n\n**Detailed Reasoning:** The debate hinged on whether professors should be objective analysts or activists. Proposition\u2019s principles and evidence (neutrality=trust, advocacy=risks) formed a logically airtight case. Opposition\u2019s advocacy-focused framework relied on emotional appeals and failed evidence rigor. Key rebuttals (e.g., lockdown backfire, *Nature* study) directly countered opposition premises, leaving their case inoperable.  \n\n---\n\n**V. Line-by-Line Justification**  \n- **Prop 1 (Opening):** Validated neutrality principle and welfare of safeguards; centrally successful.  \n- **Opp 1 (Opening):** Overstated advocacy\u2019s universality and failed to address neutrality until rebuttals.  \n- **Prop Rebuttal (Clash 1):** Effectively rebutted moral obligation via objectivity; Opp\u2019s weak response.  \n- **Opp Rebuttal (Clash 3):** Cited Pew 2022, but Proposition already had 2021 data, showing consistency.  \n- **Prop Final:** Refocused on academic role definitions, which Opp could not counter.  \n- **Opp Final:** Admitted risks of neutrality but lacked proof advocacy\u2019s benefits outweigh them.  \n\nAll arguments addressed, minor points incorporated. Proposition\u2019s rebuttal-heavy approach left Opp with fewer conclusive claims."

Core Judging Principles\n\nI.1 Direct Clash Resolution:\n\nClash 1: Moral Obligation to Advocate vs. Academic Neutrality\n\n* Proposition: \"The core role of professors is to provide objective, evidence-based analysis, not to advocate for specific political or social positions. When professors engage in advocacy, they risk undermining the perceived neutrality of academia, which is crucial for maintaining public trust.\"\n* Opposition: \"Professors, as experts in their fields, have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy to inform and educate society on critical social and political issues...  Engaging in advocacy allows professors to provide the public with informed perspectives grounded in research, thus enhancing democratic dialogue.\"\n\nAnalysis:  Both sides present valid principles. The opposition's argument about informed perspectives is compelling, but the proposition successfully links advocacy to a potential loss of neutrality, impacting public trust, and provides supporting evidence (Pew Research 2021).  The opposition doesn't fully address this concern about compromised objectivity, particularly given the readily apparent current political climate.\n\nWinner: Proposition. While both sides make principled arguments, the proposition more effectively connects advocacy to decreased public trust and academic integrity.  The opposition's examples of positive advocacy do not fully alleviate the concerns raised about the risks to perceived neutrality.\n\nClash 2: Societal Impact of Advocacy\n\n* Proposition: \"Advocacy is not consistently beneficial and can cause harm when the full complexity of issues is not considered. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, some public health experts advocated for policies like lockdowns, which...had unintended consequences such as economic downturns and mental health crises.\"\n* Opposition: \"Active engagement by professors in public advocacy can lead to significant societal impact and policy change. Historically, professors such as Angela Davis...have utilized their platforms to advocate for social justice, resulting in heightened awareness and legislative change.\"\n\nAnalysis: The opposition offers strong historical examples (Angela Davis, COVID-19 policy influence), but the proposition rightly points out that these are potentially cherry-picked and don\u2019t represent a complete picture. Prop's COVID-19 lockdown counter-example, illustrating unintended negative consequences, significantly weakens the opposition's generalized claim of positive impact. The cited Stanford study is critiqued for not accounting for potential negative externalities.  The opposition partially addresses this by citing the National Academies of Sciences meta-analysis indicating a disconnect between expert credibility and actual policy reception, however it doesn't fully mitigate the proposition's more specific negative impact example.\n\nWinner: Proposition. While both sides offer examples, the proposition\u2019s critique of cherry-picking combined with concrete demonstration of negative consequences ultimately makes their argument more compelling. Opposition's evidence fails to fully rebut concerns about potential harm.\n\nClash 3: Advocacy and Academic Credibility\n\n* Proposition: \"When academics engage in advocacy, it often leads to decreased trust in their findings because the public perceives them as biased or partisan... A 2020 study published in Nature found that...it often leads to decreased trust in their findings.\"\n* Opposition: \"Public advocacy by professors can enhance the credibility of research and academia in society. A report from the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) reveals that public engagement by academics increases public trust...\"\n\nAnalysis:  Both sides present evidence. However, the proposition's *Nature* study directly links advocacy to decreased trust due to perceived bias, which is a strong point.  The opposition\u2019s AAUP study focuses on public engagement but doesn't specifically address the implications of advocacy itself, allowing for potential confounding factors.  The opposition also brings up later conflicting evidence, demonstrating the instability in scientific perception of this issue .\n\nWinner: Proposition. Prop's evidence more directly addresses the core issue of advocacy and its impact on trust, highlighting the risk of perceived bias.  The opposition's evidence is less specific to advocacy itself and doesn't effectively counter the proposition's concerns about decreased trust due to perceived partisanship.\n\nI.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\nProposition Core Argument: Academic neutrality is paramount for maintaining public trust and the integrity of academia. This outweighs any potential benefits of advocacy, which risks introducing bias, undermining credibility, and leading to negative unintended consequences.\n\nOpposition Core Argument: Professors have a moral obligation and a practical opportunity to leverage their expertise through public advocacy, leading to positive societal impact and enhanced public understanding of critical issues.\n\nLogical Links and Impacts: Both sides establish reasonable links between their core arguments and supporting claims.  The proposition\u2019s impact is stronger: maintaining public trust is foundational to the legitimacy and effectiveness of academia. The opposition's impact, while positive (societal improvement), is less clearly linked to advocacy as the primary driver of change.  The proposition's impact about preserving credibility seems like the most fundamental and necessary ground to ensure that academia remains functioning and impactful even when addressing inherently difficult or controversial issues.\n\nRelative Importance:  The most central argument is the clash of neutrality vs. advocacy.  This clash addresses the foundational role of professors and determines how their actions influence public trust and the overall function of academia. Declining the motion ensures the integrity of the system before considering potentially fraught secondary questions about whether advocacy creates net benefit or harm.\n\nI.3 Weighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments & Consistency:\n\nThe proposition focuses on the principle of academic neutrality, while the opposition balances principle (moral obligation) with practical arguments (societal impact). The proposition effectively argues that the practical benefits of advocacy are uncertain and potentially harmful, while the principle of neutrality provides a stable foundation for public trust.  The opposition's principled argument about a \"moral obligation\" could potentially outweigh practical considerations but is strongly challenged by the proposition.  The strength of the proposition's practical arguments, which demonstrate that advocacy can be harmful, mitigate against an overriding focus on the moral obligation, thus requiring more stringent criteria for what is acceptable advocacy.\n\nBoth sides maintain relatively consistent arguments. The opposition initially claims advocacy enhances credibility, but later acknowledges potential negative impacts on trust due to perceived bias, creating some internal tension.\n\nII. Evaluation Requirements (Met - steelmanning applied throughout, argument-based decision making, presentation ignored, framework neutrality maintained)\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors (Avoided)\n\nIV. Decision Making:\n\nWinner: Proposition\n\nConfidence Level: 75.  The proposition successfully challenges the core assumptions of the opposition's case by raising serious concerns about advocacy's impact on neutrality, trust, and academic credibility. While the opposition presents a valid argument for the potential benefits of advocacy, they don't fully address the risks identified by the proposition, particularly the potential for decreased public trust.\n\nKey Factors:\n1. The clash between academic neutrality and advocacy. The proposition effectively argues that neutrality is essential for maintaining public trust and academic integrity, while advocacy risks undermining both.\n2. The proposition's counter-examples and evidence demonstrating the potential negative consequences of advocacy. This weakens the opposition's argument that advocacy consistently leads to positive change.\n3. The proposition successfully links advocacy to a decrease in public trust via increased instances of perceived bias, further damaging the opposition's argument.\n\nDetailed Reasoning: The proposition frames the debate effectively by emphasizing the importance of  academic neutrality as a foundation for trust. They systematically challenge the opposition\u2019s claims by highlighting potential negative consequences of advocacy, providing concrete examples where advocacy has backfired or been perceived as partisan, and presenting evidence suggesting that advocacy can erode public trust in academia.  While the opposition offers examples of positive societal impact resulting from advocacy, they struggle to rebut the proposition\u2019s concerns about the risks to academic objectivity and public trust.  The depth and consistency of the proposition\u2019s attack on the central tenets of advocacy justify a clear, though not decisive, victory for the proposition.\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\n\n* Prop 1:  Establishes the proposition\u2019s core arguments: moral duty, enhanced relevance, and safeguards for credibility.\n* Opp 1:  Mirrors the proposition\u2019s structure but focuses on the moral obligation to inform and educate.\n* Prop Rebuttal 1:  Introduces the crucial counter-principle of academic neutrality and challenges the opposition's core claims with counter-evidence and critique.\n* Opp Rebuttal 1: Acknowledges the tension between advocacy and objectivity but maintains that the benefits of advocacy are essential for affecting change.\n* Prop Final: Consolidates arguments focusing on key clashes and the importance of academic integrity and societal impact, effectively framing voting issues.\n* Opp Final: Reiterates core arguments while attempting to address the proposition\u2019s concerns, but doesn\u2019t fully overcome the challenges to academic integrity and public trust.\n\n\n"

      "confidence": 85,
      "logic": "**I. Core Judging Principles**\n\n**1. Direct Clash Resolution**\n\n**Clash 1: Moral Obligation vs. Academic Neutrality**\n- **Proposition:** Argues that professors have a moral duty to engage in public advocacy based on the principle of academic social responsibility.\n- **Opposition:** Counters with the principle of academic neutrality, stating that advocacy risks undermining the perceived neutrality of academia.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s principle of academic social responsibility is compelling but lacks specific evidence to support the claim that advocacy is universally beneficial. The Opposition\u2019s principle of academic neutrality is stronger, supported by evidence from Pew Research (2021) showing that public trust in academia is highest when professors are perceived as neutral. The Opposition effectively undermines the Proposition\u2019s claim by highlighting the risks of advocacy leading to public skepticism or polarization.\n- **Winner:** Opposition\n\n**Clash 2: Public Advocacy as a Catalyst for Policy Change**\n- **Proposition:** Provides examples like Dr. Anthony Fauci and Professor Naomi Oreskes to show that advocacy leads to significant societal impact.\n- **Opposition:** Critiques these examples as cherry-picked and points out instances where advocacy has backfired, such as the economic downturns and mental health crises resulting from COVID-19 lockdowns.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s examples are strong but limited in scope. The Opposition\u2019s critique is effective, showing that advocacy is not consistently beneficial and can cause harm. The Opposition\u2019s evidence from the National Academies of Sciences further weakens the Proposition\u2019s claim by indicating that advocacy does not always lead to effective policy dialogue.\n- **Winner:** Opposition\n\n**Clash 3: Credibility of Academia**\n- **Proposition:** Claims that public advocacy enhances the credibility of research and academia, citing the AAUP report.\n- **Opposition:** Counters with evidence from a 2020 *Nature* study showing that advocacy decreases public trust in academic findings when perceived as politically motivated.\n- **Analysis:** The Opposition\u2019s counterevidence is more compelling, directly challenging the Proposition\u2019s claim. The Opposition effectively argues that neutrality, not advocacy, is the foundation of academic credibility.\n- **Winner:** Opposition\n\n**2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact**\n- **Proposition\u2019s Core Arguments:** Moral duty to advocate, practical benefits of advocacy, and safeguards ensuring credibility.\n- **Opposition\u2019s Core Arguments:** Importance of academic neutrality, risks of advocacy leading to harm, and the erosion of public trust.\n- **Analysis:** The Opposition\u2019s arguments are more central to resolving the motion. The principle of academic neutrality and the risks associated with advocacy are more impactful than the Proposition\u2019s claims, which are either less universally applicable or effectively countered.\n\n**3. Consistency and Contradictions**\n- **Proposition:** Consistent in advocating for public advocacy but relies on limited examples and does not adequately address the risks.\n- **Opposition:** Consistent in emphasizing academic neutrality and effectively counters the Proposition\u2019s claims with strong evidence.\n- **Analysis:** The Opposition maintains a more consistent and logically sound case throughout the debate.\n\n**II. Evaluation Requirements**\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides\u2019 arguments were presented in their strongest form.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The decision is based solely on the arguments made within the debate.\n- **Ignore Presentation:** Focused exclusively on the substance of the arguments.\n- **Framework Neutrality:** Maintained neutrality between the competing frameworks of academic social responsibility and academic neutrality.\n\n**III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID**\n- **Intervention:** Did not introduce own arguments or evidence.\n- **Shifting the Burden of Proof:** Both sides were held to the same standard.\n- **Over-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** Evaluated all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\n- **Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** Addressed all dropped arguments.\n- **Double-Counting:** Did not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\n- **Assuming Causation from Correlation:** Demanded clear evidence of causal mechanisms.\n- **Not Justifying Clash Decisions:** Provided explicit justification for every clash decision.\n\n**IV. Decision Making**\n- **Winner:** Opposition\n- **Confidence Level:** 85 (Clear Victory)\n- **Key Factors:** The principle of academic neutrality, the risks of advocacy leading to harm, and the erosion of public trust were the most crucial factors. These factors were decisive because they directly challenged the Proposition\u2019s core arguments and provided a stronger rationale for the Opposition\u2019s position.\n- **Detailed Reasoning:** The Opposition effectively dismantled the Proposition\u2019s arguments by challenging their principles, critiquing their evidence, and providing superior counterarguments. The principle of academic neutrality and the risks associated with advocacy were more impactful and logically sound, leading to a clear victory for the Opposition.\n\n**V. Line-by-Line Justification**\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** The Proposition presents a strong case for public advocacy based on moral duty, practical benefits, and safeguards. However, the arguments are somewhat limited in scope and do not adequately address the risks of advocacy.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** The Opposition effectively counters the Proposition\u2019s claims by emphasizing the importance of academic neutrality and the risks of advocacy leading to harm and eroding public trust.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** The Proposition attempts to counter the Opposition\u2019s arguments but relies on limited examples and does not effectively address the risks of advocacy.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** The Opposition effectively critiques the Proposition\u2019s arguments, providing strong evidence to support the principle of academic neutrality and the risks of advocacy.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** The Proposition reiterates its arguments but does not adequately address the Opposition\u2019s critiques or provide sufficient evidence to support its claims.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** The Opposition effectively summarizes its case, emphasizing the importance of academic neutrality and the risks of advocacy, and provides strong evidence to support its position.\n\n<winnerName>opposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>85</confidence>"
