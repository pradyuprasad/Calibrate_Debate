    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: Professors have a moral obligation to share their expertise with the public to inform and improve societal discourse on critical issues.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details: \n- The principle of social responsibility in academia suggests that experts have a duty to contribute to the public good by applying their knowledge to real-world problems.\n- This principle is valid because it recognizes the significant impact that academic expertise can have on policy decisions and public understanding.\n- It applies here because professors, by virtue of their expertise, are uniquely positioned to provide insight and guidance on complex social and political issues, thereby enhancing the quality of public debate and decision-making.\nConnection: By engaging in public advocacy, professors fulfill their social responsibility, ensuring that their knowledge is used for the greater good, which in turn strengthens democratic processes and promotes more informed civic engagement.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: Public engagement by professors can significantly enhance the credibility and relevance of academic research and institutions.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n- For instance, research has shown that public engagement activities by academics can increase the impact of their research, making it more accessible and relevant to broader audiences (e.g., the work of climate scientists informing policy on global warming).\n- Real-world cases, such as the role of economists in shaping fiscal policy during the 2008 financial crisis, demonstrate how academic expertise can directly influence critical decision-making processes.\n- The relevance to the topic is clear: when professors engage in public advocacy, they not only contribute to better-informed public discourse but also demonstrate the practical value of academic research, thereby enhancing its credibility and relevance.\nConnection: This evidence supports the claim by showing that public engagement by professors has a direct, positive impact on both the perception and application of academic research, ultimately benefiting society by ensuring that knowledge is used to address pressing issues.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\nCore Claim: Engaging in public advocacy can also foster a more engaged and informed citizenry, which is essential for a healthy democracy.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n- The principle of democratic participation emphasizes the importance of an informed and active citizenry in the functioning of a democracy.\n- This principle is important because it underlines the need for citizens to be equipped with accurate and unbiased information to make informed decisions.\n- It applies here because professors, through public advocacy, can provide critical information and perspectives that are grounded in evidence, thereby empowering citizens to participate more effectively in democratic processes.\nConnection: By advocating on social and political issues, professors facilitate better public understanding and engagement, which are foundational to a vibrant democracy, thereby supporting the claim that their public advocacy is not only beneficial but necessary for the health of democratic societies.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n- The arguments presented work together to form a unified case that underscores the importance, impact, and moral obligation of professors to engage in public advocacy. \n- Collectively, they prove that such engagement is crucial for informing public discourse, enhancing the relevance and credibility of academic research, and fostering a more informed and active citizenry.\n- The real-world impact of professors' public advocacy is significant, influencing policy decisions, shaping public opinion, and contributing to the solving of complex societal problems.\n- These arguments link back to key themes of social responsibility, democratic participation, and the application of knowledge for the public good, highlighting the critical role that professors play in society beyond the academic sphere.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of moral obligation, enhanced credibility of research, and fostering of democratic participation through public engagement by professors not only supports the motion but highlights its necessity in contemporary society. By actively engaging in public advocacy on social and political issues, professors can make a tangible, positive impact on public discourse and policy, ultimately contributing to a more informed, engaged, and just society.",
      "rebuttal": " and integrity\n\nThe primary aim of this opposition speech is to demonstrate that while professors may have expertise that could contribute positively to public discourse, the risks associated with active public advocacy, including the compromise of academic objectivity, the creation of hostile learning environments, and the potential damage to research credibility, outweigh these potential benefits. By focusing on these critical issues and emphasizing the importance of maintaining academic neutrality, the opposition presents a compelling case against the motion.",
