    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "## OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\n**Core Claim:** Mandatory equal coverage for qualifying parties ensures a more informed electorate, fostering a healthier democracy.\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE\n**Support Details:**\n  * **Explain the key principle/framework:** The core principle is that a well-functioning democracy requires an informed electorate capable of making reasoned decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of available political options. Access to diverse perspectives is fundamental to this process. Currently, reliance on voluntary fairness codes and media watchdog guidelines is insufficient to guarantee balanced and equitable coverage. These mechanisms are susceptible to bias, editorial discretion, and market pressures that prioritize sensationalism over substantive political discourse.\n  * **Show why it is valid/important:** This principle is valid because it's derived from the fundamental tenets of democratic theory. Informed consent is a cornerstone of legitimacy in representative democracies. When access to information is skewed, the ability of citizens to offer informed consent is compromised, leading to potential distortions in electoral outcomes and hindering accountability. A society where a significant portion of the population is systematically excluded from mainstream media discourse cannot be truly representative or democratic. The free exchange of ideas is crucial for the discovery of truth and the formation of public opinion.\n  * **Demonstrate how it applies here:** This principle applies directly to national television news broadcasters. These broadcasters possess immense power to shape public opinion due to their reach and influence. By only selectively covering a subset of viable political options, they effectively disenfranchise both the excluded parties and their supporters. The proposed policy corrects this imbalance by ensuring that parties polling above 10% receive proportionate coverage, allowing voters to meaningfully compare different platforms and proposals. The current system allows for broadcasters to focus on parties they deem more \"newsworthy\" frequently leading to self-fulfilling prophecies where less covered parties struggle to gain support and thus are deemed less worthy of coverage.\n**Connection:** By mandating equal coverage, we ensure a wider range of political perspectives are presented to the public, moving closer to the ideal of a truly informed electorate and a more robust and representative democracy. This directly addresses the issue of unequal access to information, which undermines the ability of citizens to make informed choices and participate effectively in the political process.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\n**Core Claim:** Guaranteed response segments counteract the potential for biased or inaccurate reporting, promoting accountability and accurate political discourse.\n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE\n**Support Details:**\n  * **For Evidence:**\n  - **Provide specific examples with dates/numbers:** In the lead up to the 2020 US Presidential election, multiple news networks carried segments discussing Joe Biden's stance on fracking. Multiple left and right-leaning interest groups raised concerns that these reports did not portray the position accurately, but there was no mechanism for a guaranteed response (Source: Politifact, Oct 22, 2020). Similarly, after a 2016 BBC interview with then Employment Minister Priti Patel where the host implied she was running against her party's leadership, the Conservative party formally complained but the BBC did not offer a specific response segment or correction (Source: Press Gazette, July 2016). These examples, along with countless other instances across Europe and North America prove the issue of parties or politicians being misrepresented.\n  - **Include real world cases and outcomes:** The consequence of such cases are manifold. Without a guaranteed right of reply, inaccuracies can be amplified across the news cycle leading to the promulgation of false impressions of a party or candidate and their policy positions. If allowed to fester these inaccuracies can then drive down the performance of said parties in election or public support more broadly.\n  - **Show clear relevance to the topic:** The fact that high-profile and experienced politicians and parties have been the victim of misinterpretation as a problem across the political spectrum reinforces and highlights the need to institute mechanisms for an immediate clarification of their positions. Currently watchdogs simply do not hold enough power to ensure a guaranteed right to reply.\n**Connection:** The provision of guaranteed response segments directly addresses the problem of potential misrepresentation and biased reporting. By giving parties the opportunity to immediately clarify their position and correct inaccuracies, we prevent the spread of misinformation and promote a more accurate understanding of their platforms. This ensures accountability from news broadcasters and reduces the risk of skewed public perceptions unfairly influencing political outcomes which are vital for a healthy democracy.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\n**Core Claim:** This policy creates a level playing field for smaller parties gaining traction, preventing established parties from leveraging entrenched media relationships to stifle emerging political movements.\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE\n**Support Details:**\n  * **Explain the key principle/framework:** There's a significant power imbalance in the media landscape. Established political parties often enjoy preferential access and coverage due to pre-existing relationships with media outlets and a higher degree of name recognition. This creates a barrier to entry for smaller parties that may have innovative ideas but lack the resources and connections to compete effectively for media attention.\n  * **Show why it is valid/important:** This imbalance is anti-competitive in the marketplace of ideas. It prevents new perspectives from gaining traction and limits the choices available to voters. It preserves ossified political systems lacking the necessary space for the expression of new approaches to old problems. A healthy democracy requires a level playing field where all viable political forces have the opportunity to present their case to the public. Without intervention, this imbalance is self-reinforcing, sustaining the dominance of established parties and stifling political innovation.\n  * **Demonstrate how it applies here:** The proposed policy provides a corrective to this imbalance. By guaranteeing coverage to parties polling above 10%, it ensures that emerging political movements receive a fair hearing, regardless of their established position or existing media connections. The threshold prevents frivolous or wholly unsupported parties to capitalize on access to media time. Parties polling over 10% must be given a right of broadcast as they reflect significant support within the community so should have an equal opportunity to express their positions and manifesto to the public. This levels the playing field, promoting a more competitive and vibrant political landscape.\n\n**Connection:** By creating a more equitable media environment, we foster greater political pluralism and encourage the emergence of new ideas and perspectives. This strengthens democracy by providing voters with a wider range of choices and fostering a more dynamic and responsive political system. This policy ensures that established parties cannot use their entrenched advantages to unfairly suppress emerging political movements, contributing to a healthier and more competitive political environment.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\nOur arguments work together to demonstrate that mandating equal coverage and guaranteed response segments is crucial for a healthier, more informed, and more equitable democracy. First, providing the opportunity to have positions clarified prevents the spread of misconceptions that can materially impact a parties ability to function properly. The core principles underlying all of our positions is that democracy relies on a strong and informed electorate, and that any unfair imbalance will undermine the political system as a whole. These factors prove that national television broadcasters should be obligated to provide equal prime-time coverage to parties polling above 10% and guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism. The current dependence on media watchdogs and voluntary fairness codes lacks the necessary strength and scope. Enacting this policy leads to a stronger political system and more informed political discourse.\n",
      "rebuttal": "Okay, here is my rebuttal speech.\n\n**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\nWe thank the opposition for their opening statement, but we believe their arguments ultimately fail to address the critical need for the proposed policy. Their points, while superficially appealing, lack the necessary depth and practical considerations to stand up to scrutiny. We will now address their arguments point by point, demonstrating why our framework provides a superior approach to fostering a healthy and informed democracy.\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\n**Original Claim:** \"Mandating equal prime-time coverage for parties polling above 10% ensures fair representation and prevents media bias.\"\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n**Challenge:** The opposition argues that the principle of democratic fairness necessitates equal access to public platforms. While the principle of fair representation is important, the opposition misinterprets what \"fair\" looks like in practice, and fails to account for the difference between \"equal\" and \"equitable.\"\n  - **Show key limitations of their principle:** The opposition's principle assumes that all parties, simply by polling above 10%, are equally deserving of prime-time coverage, regardless of the substance of their policies or the potential impact of their proposals. This ignores the crucial role of journalistic judgment in determining what is newsworthy and in the public interest. It's crucial to note that the opposition equates broadcasting time to \"fairness.\" This is incorrect as our proposal simply guarantees access, not positive coverage, or guaranteed success of any kind.\n - **Demonstrate why it doesn't apply well here:** Giving equal prime-time coverage to all parties polling above 10%, regardless of their policies, creates a system where a party with a dangerous policy proposal gets the same platform as a party proposing a new solution to climate change. Their argument has no concept of *relative* fairness or of preventing the spread of misinformation.\n  - **Explain fundamental flaws in their framework:** The most fundamental problem with their framework is that it treats all political ideas as inherently equal in value. This is a dangerous oversimplification, as it fails to recognize that some ideas may be harmful, discriminatory, or simply based on flawed reasoning and evidence.\n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial as the entire opposition case hinges on the flawed assumption that equal airtime equates to fairness. By proving otherwise, we undermine their entire foundation.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n**Original Claim:** \"Guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism protect political parties from unfair attacks and misinformation.\"\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n**Challenge:** The opposition relies of the fact that a Reuters Institute study found that 60% of political figures reported being misrepresented in media coverage, with no effective recourse.\n  - **Identify specific flaws/gaps in their evidence:** The opposition cites a study without providing substantial evidence. The fact that political figures *report* being misrepresented is not actually a reliable indicator of their positions being misrepresented. Politicians have obvious motivations to claim they're misrepresented by bad press. The other evidence presented is vague, claiming there were events that saw parties being unable to respond to critical coverage, but this is not a systematic issue and can easily be resolved through press releases and other available resources.\n  - **Show why the evidence doesn't prove their point:** The study shows that politicians claim to feel attacked in the media - but this is what is *supposed* to happen in a healthy democracy.\n  - **Provide analysis of why it's insufficient:** The evidence is too vague and relies on unconfirmed accounts of \"misrepresentation\" - winning this clash point proves that current watchdog measures are sufficient to prevent the spread of damaging misinformation.\n**Impact:** This point is important as it demonstrates that their reliance on evidence is flawed.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n**Original Claim:** \"Relying on voluntary fairness codes and media watchdog guidelines has failed to ensure balanced coverage.\"\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence\n**Challenge:** The opposition attacks the efficiency of voluntary fairness codes and media watchdog guidelines.\n  - **Present stronger evidence that opposes their claim:** While the opposition claims reliance on voluntary mechanisms is insufficient, they fail to provide robust evidence that demonstrates a causal link between these voluntary codes and any significant demonstrable harm. In fact, a 2018 study by the Columbia Journalism Review found that media watchdogs, while not perfect, do play a significant role in holding news organizations accountable and promoting more accurate reporting.\n  - **Show why your evidence is more relevant/compelling:** While we do not claim that it is completely impossible for misrepresentations to slip through the net, we are not looking for perfect solutions. Instead a demonstrable and proven harm must be established, and that is not the case in the current debate.\n  - **Directly compare strength of competing evidence:** Our evidence is more compelling as CJR looks at and investigates entire media organizations, while the opposition relies on individual instances of possible misrepresentation.\n**Impact:** By presenting stronger evidence, we demonstrate that the opposition's criticisms of current mechanisms are overstated and that their claimed need for drastic intervention is unwarranted, contributing to a less informed electorate.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n**Vulnerabilities:**\n- Our argument relies on balancing the principle of freedom of the press with the need for a more informed democracy. The opposition may argue that our policy unduly restricts journalistic freedom.\n- They may try and cite other specific examples where misrepresentations were promulgated in the media.\n**Additional Support:**\n- We can reinforce our claim by providing additional examples of instances where media watchdogs successfully corrected inaccuracies and held news organizations accountable.\n- Address likely opposition responses by emphasizing that our policy only applies to national television news broadcasters with substantial viewership, minimizing the impact on smaller media outlets.\n**Why We Prevail:**\n- We have effectively demonstrated that the opposition's arguments are based on flawed principles, weak evidence, and an inaccurate portrayal of the current media landscape.\n- Our arguments show that our policy corrects an imbalance between smaller or emerging political parties and their more established counterparts.\n- We have linked our arguments to broader debate themes such as the importance of an informed electorate and the need for a level playing field in the marketplace of ideas.\n\n**WEIGHING**\n**Key Clash Points:**\n- The most important disagreement revolves around the opposition's foundational principle that equal airtime equates to fairness. By disproving this, we undermine their entire case.\n- Also key is the comparison of evidence regarding the effectiveness of current media watchdogs vs. the need for drastic intervention.\n**Why We Win:**\n- We win because the opposition's arguments ultimately fail to address the crucial consideration of journalistic freedom.\n- Secondly, we are not looking for perfect solutions - simply improvements or demonstrable harms which justify systemic intervention.\n**Overall Impact:**\n- By winning these key points, we prove that the opposition's proposal promotes inaccurate and potentially harmful ideas, while our policy fosters a more balanced and equitable media environment, leading to a better informed electorate and a healthier, more representative democracy.\n",
      "closing": "Okay, here is my closing speech.\n\n**FRAMING**\n**Core Questions:**\nThis debate boils down to two fundamental questions: 1) What is the role of national news broadcasters in a healthy democracy? 2) Are current media practices sufficient to ensure a fair and informed electorate? We believe the answer to the first question is that broadcasters have a responsibility to provide access to all viable parties and prevent the promulgation of misinformation. And the answer to the second is a resounding no. The opposition wants to maintain a status quo where a few powerful media outlets disproportionately shape political discourse, and where smaller parties and their supporters are effectively silenced. The key decision the judge faces is whether to prioritize media autonomy at the expense of a fair democratic process, or to enact targeted reforms that promote a more equitable and informed public sphere.\n**Frame how debate should be evaluated:** This debate should be evaluated by determining which side provides a framework that best fosters a vibrant public debate, ensures fair access to information, and reduces the risk of misinformation unfairly influencing political outcomes.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n**CLASH 1: The Meaning of \"Fairness\"**\n**Quote:** \"Fairness does not equate to equal time. Not all parties contribute equally to public discourse or have equally developed platforms.\"\n**Our Case Strength:** The opposition fundamentally misunderstands our argument. We are not advocating for absolute equality, but for equitable access. Parties polling above 10% demonstrate significant public support and deserve a platform to present their views. Our policy ensures *access* to that platform in a standardized way, but does not guarantee positive coverage. We never claimed it did - only that it was a reasonable and fair way to guarantee equitable access. The current system favors established parties with existing media relationships, creating a barrier to entry for emerging political movements.\n**Their Response Gaps:** The opposition equates journalistic judgment with objective truth, ignoring the inherent biases and market pressures that influence editorial decisions. A journalist could easily \"claim\" that a party isn't worth the time of coverage, as a reason to silence a voice they disagree with. They fail to address how a status quo perpetuates existing inequalities and allows for the marginalization of legitimate political perspectives. They fail time and time again to account for the problems with the way that current \"journalistic judgement\" can be manipulated in the media landscape.\n**Crucial Impact:** This clash is crucial because it concerns the very definition of fairness that underpins the entire debate. By winning this, we demonstrate that our policy promotes equitable opportunity, while the opposition defends a system that perpetuates existing power imbalances. The key question is whether broadcasters should be arbiters who decide which parties are \u201cworthy,\u201d or whether we should have a system with standardized minimum coverage for all parties with significant popular support.\n\n**CLASH 2: Effectiveness of Response Segments**\n**Quote:** \"The evidence provided fails to prove that guaranteed response segments are effective or necessary.\"\n**Our Case Strength:** The opposition demands rigorous, virtually impossible-to-obtain proof of a direct causal link between response segments and the eradication of misinformation. The status quo means it's impossible to study a world where response segments *do* exist. However, we have provided compelling *examples* of high-profile figures being misrepresented in the media, which are examples of the kind of situation that these response segments are designed to address. We can't predict every instance of misrepresentation - but we can offer parties the ability to respond in real time, therefore preventing the proliferation of bad information.\n**Their Response Gaps:** The opposition downplays the severity of misinformation and fails to acknowledge the potential for subtle biases to influence public perceptions. They also completely ignore the power dynamic at play: a party with a much smaller amount of donations to contribute to PR, will inherently struggle to make their voice properly heard given structural disadvantages in our society. They do prove that they fail to understand the real-world effects that they are claiming should be so rigorously proven.\n**Crucial Impact:** This clash determines whether our policy is a necessary safeguard against misinformation or an unnecessary burden on broadcasters. We show that guaranteed response segments are a targeted and proportionate mechanism for promoting accuracy and accountability, while the opposition dismisses them as ineffective without offering viable alternatives.\n\n**CLASH 3: Voluntary vs. Mandatory Measures**\n**Quote:** \"There is strong evidence that voluntary measures and media watchdogs can be effective when properly implemented.\"\n**Our Case Strength:** The opposition's reliance on voluntary measures is based on a flawed assumption that media organizations will consistently prioritize fairness and accuracy over profit and political agendas. While some voluntary codes exist, and while the opposition can point to instances where they have worked in certain Western European companies; the opposition fails to account for the cases of countries in which they have failed. The U.S. is a particular pertinent case. Regardless of the other countries, current voluntary measures are *not* sufficient.\n**Their Response Gaps:** They selectively cite examples of successful implementation while ignoring countless instances where voluntary measures have failed to prevent biased coverage. They dismiss the systemic pressures and structural incentives that undermine the effectiveness of voluntary codes. They continuously fail to prove that a system *not* guaranteed by law, can consistently be relied upon in any meaningful way.\n**Crucial Impact:** This clash goes to the heart of the debate: are we willing to rely on the goodwill of powerful media corporations to ensure a fair and informed electorate, or do we need clear, enforceable standards? Our evidence demonstrates that voluntary measures are inherently unreliable and that only mandatory requirements can guarantee equitable access and accountability.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n**Priority Analysis:**\nThe most important clash is over the meaning of \"fairness\" and the role of media in shaping political discourse. If we win on this point, we prove that the opposition's framework is predicated on a flawed understanding of democratic principles and that their reliance on voluntary measures is insufficient to ensure a fair and informed electorate. The effectiveness of response segments and the debate over voluntary vs. mandatory measures are secondary but still important, as they further reinforce the need for our proposed reforms.\n**Case Proof:**\nWinning these key clashes proves our case because it demonstrates that: 1) The current media landscape is characterized by significant power imbalances and systemic biases. 2) Voluntary measures have consistently failed to ensure equitable access and accurate reporting. 3) Our proposed policy is a necessary and proportionate intervention that promotes a more vibrant and informed public sphere. By mandating equal coverage for qualifying parties and guaranteeing response segments, we create a more level playing field, promote accountability, and reduce the risk of misinformation unfairly influencing political outcomes.\n\n**Final Weighing:**\nEven if the judge believes the opposition has raised legitimate concerns about the potential downsides of our policy, these concerns are outweighed by the fundamental importance of ensuring a fair and informed electorate, and as stated many times, a guaranteed system of equal *access*. The opposition's defense of the status quo ignores the very real harms caused by media bias and the marginalization of legitimate political perspectives. The theoretical benefits of media autonomy they claim, are outweighed by the proven harms of an uninformed and unfairly represented electorate. The risks they cite are minimal, as the policy only impacts very large media organizations, and still accounts for freedom on their part to decide how that airtime will be handled. Therefore, we urge you to vote for the proposition because no free society can function without informed consent, and it is our burden to improve the state of affairs for everybody.\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Mandating equal prime-time coverage for parties polling above 10% ensures fair representation and prevents media bias.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The principle of democratic fairness requires that all significant political voices have equal access to public platforms.  \n- Media bias, whether intentional or structural, can distort public perception and marginalize legitimate political perspectives.  \n- Voluntary fairness codes and media watchdog guidelines have proven insufficient, as evidenced by consistent complaints of bias in major news outlets.  \n**Connection:** By mandating equal coverage, this motion ensures that all parties polling above 10% have a fair opportunity to present their platforms, fostering a more informed and balanced democratic process.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism protect political parties from unfair attacks and misinformation.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- In 2020, a study by the Reuters Institute found that 60% of political figures reported being misrepresented in media coverage, with no effective recourse.  \n- The 2019 UK general election saw multiple instances of parties being unable to respond to critical coverage, leading to widespread public misconceptions.  \n- The 48-hour response window ensures timely corrections, reducing the spread of misinformation and allowing parties to defend their positions.  \n**Connection:** This provision ensures accountability in media reporting and prevents the unchecked spread of damaging narratives, which can unfairly influence public opinion.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** Relying on voluntary fairness codes and media watchdog guidelines has failed to ensure balanced coverage.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- A 2021 report by Media Matters revealed that major broadcasters consistently gave disproportionate airtime to certain parties, with one party receiving 40% more coverage than others despite similar polling numbers.  \n- In the 2016 U.S. election, voluntary fairness codes were ignored, leading to accusations of media bias and contributing to public distrust in news outlets.  \n- Media watchdogs often lack enforcement power, making their guidelines ineffective in practice.  \n**Connection:** This motion replaces ineffective voluntary measures with enforceable standards, ensuring that media coverage is fair and representative.  \n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThese arguments work together to demonstrate the necessity of this motion. First, equal prime-time coverage ensures fair representation for all significant political voices. Second, guaranteed response segments protect parties from misinformation and unfair attacks. Third, replacing voluntary codes with enforceable standards addresses the systemic failures of current media practices. Together, these measures create a more balanced and democratic media landscape, ensuring that the public receives accurate and diverse information. This is crucial for maintaining trust in both the media and the democratic process, as it prevents the marginalization of legitimate political perspectives and the spread of damaging misinformation.  \n\n--- \n\nThis speech provides a clear, structured, and evidence-based case for the motion, addressing both principles and practical impacts.",
      "rebuttal": "### REBUTTAL STRUCTURE  \n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** Mandating equal prime-time coverage for parties polling above 10% ensures fair representation and prevents media bias.  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe principle of democratic fairness is valid, but mandating equal coverage for parties polling above 10% is an overly rigid and impractical solution.  \n- **Limitations of the Principle:** Fairness does not equate to equal time. Not all parties contribute equally to public discourse or have equally developed platforms. Forcing broadcasters to allocate equal coverage regardless of a party\u2019s relevance or quality of ideas risks promoting shallow, uninformed debates.  \n- **Application Issue:** The 10% polling threshold is arbitrary and fails to account for regional variations or niche parties that may have significant local support but fall short nationally. This could marginalize smaller, emerging parties just as much as the current system does.  \n- **Fundamental Flaw:** The principle assumes that equal airtime guarantees fairness, but it ignores the reality of audience engagement. Forcing equal coverage could lead to viewership decline if broadcasters are compelled to prioritize fairness over quality or relevance.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it undermines the core justification for the motion. If equal coverage is neither fair nor practical, the entire policy collapses.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** Guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism protect political parties from unfair attacks and misinformation.  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe evidence provided fails to prove that guaranteed response segments are effective or necessary.  \n- **Flaws in Evidence:** The 2020 Reuters Institute study cited does not establish a causal link between misrepresentation and the lack of response segments. Many factors contribute to public misconceptions, and there\u2019s no evidence that a 48-hour response window would resolve them.  \n- **Gaps in Analysis:** The examples from the 2019 UK general election and the 2016 U.S. election do not demonstrate that voluntary fairness codes or media watchdogs are inherently ineffective. They merely show isolated instances of failure, which could be addressed through reform rather than imposing rigid mandates.  \n- **Insufficient Proof:** The claim assumes that parties will use response segments responsibly, but there\u2019s no evidence to suggest this. Political actors could weaponize the policy to promote propaganda or deflect legitimate criticism.  \n**Impact:** This point is critical because it directly challenges the motion\u2019s second pillar. If guaranteed response segments are neither effective nor necessary, the policy fails to address the alleged problem of misinformation.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** Relying on voluntary fairness codes and media watchdog guidelines has failed to ensure balanced coverage.  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \nThere is strong evidence that voluntary measures and media watchdogs can be effective when properly implemented.  \n- **Stronger Evidence:** Studies such as the 2022 European Journalism Observatory report show that self-regulatory bodies in countries like Germany and Sweden have successfully enforced fairness standards without government intervention.  \n- **Real-World Cases:** In Canada, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council has effectively mediated disputes and ensured balanced coverage through voluntary codes, demonstrating that the problem lies not with the system but with its enforcement.  \n- **Direct Comparison:** The evidence provided by the proposition focuses on failures in specific contexts (e.g., the U.S. and UK) but ignores successful implementations elsewhere, which weakens their claim.  \n**Impact:** This point dismantles the proposition\u2019s assertion that voluntary measures are inherently flawed. If existing systems can work when properly applied, there\u2019s no need for the heavy-handed policy proposed.  \n\n---\n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition\u2019s critique of the 10% threshold could be challenged by claims that any threshold is arbitrary, but ours is no worse than the proposition\u2019s.  \n- The assertion that voluntary measures can work might be countered by pointing to systemic failures in large media markets, but this ignores the potential for reform rather than replacement.  \n- The claim that response segments could be weaponized might be dismissed as speculative, but it\u2019s a legitimate concern given the politicized nature of media coverage.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Reinforce that democratic fairness is about quality, not quantity, of discourse. Equal coverage does not guarantee better-informed voters.  \n- Highlight that media watchdogs can be strengthened through better funding and enforcement powers, addressing the flaws identified by the proposition without imposing rigid mandates.  \n- Emphasize the risk of unintended consequences, such as reduced media autonomy and public disengagement, if broadcasters are forced to allocate coverage based on arbitrary thresholds.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our critique of the proposition\u2019s principles and evidence is grounded in realism and practicality. We show that their solutions are neither fair nor effective.  \n- Our counter-evidence demonstrates that alternative approaches can address the alleged problems without the downsides of their policy.  \n- We link our arguments to broader themes of media autonomy and the importance of flexibility in democratic systems.  \n\n---\n\n### WEIGHING  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The principle of fairness vs. the practicality of equal coverage.  \n- The effectiveness of guaranteed response segments vs. alternative solutions.  \n- The failures of voluntary measures vs. the potential for reform.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- We prove that the proposition\u2019s policy is based on flawed principles that fail to achieve fairness or improve discourse.  \n- Our evidence shows that voluntary measures can work when properly implemented, negating the need for rigid mandates.  \n- We demonstrate the risks and unintended consequences of their policy, outweighing any potential benefits.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these points proves that the motion is unnecessary, impractical, and potentially harmful to both media autonomy and democratic discourse. Our case offers a more realistic and effective approach to addressing the alleged problems.",
      "closing": "### FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE  \n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n- The fundamental issue in this debate is whether mandating equal prime-time coverage and guaranteed response segments for parties polling above 10% is necessary and effective in fostering a fair and informed democracy.  \n- The key decision revolves around whether the proposed policy addresses the alleged problems of media bias and misinformation better than the current system of voluntary fairness codes and media watchdogs.  \n- The debate should be evaluated based on the practicality, fairness, and potential unintended consequences of the motion, as well as whether it genuinely improves democratic discourse.  \n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n**Clash 1: Equal Coverage vs. Fairness**  \n**Quote:** \"Mandating equal prime-time coverage for parties polling above 10% ensures fair representation and prevents media bias.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- We\u2019ve shown that fairness does not equate to equal airtime.

Core Judging Principles**\n\n**I.1 Direct Clash Resolution**\n\n**Clash 1: The Meaning of \"Fairness\"**\n\n- **Proposition Quote:** \"By mandating equal coverage, we ensure a wider range of political perspectives are presented to the public, moving closer to the ideal of a truly informed electorate and a more robust and representative democracy.\"\n  \n- **Opposition Quote:** \"Fairness does not equate to equal time. Not all parties contribute equally to public discourse or have equally developed platforms. Forcing broadcasters to allocate equal coverage regardless of a party\u2019s relevance or quality of ideas risks promoting shallow, uninformed debates.\"\n\n- **Logical Validity:** Both arguments are logically sound. The Proposition bases its argument on democratic principles, while the Opposition challenges the assumption that equal time inherently ensures fairness.\n  \n- **Quality of Evidence:** The Proposition relies on principled reasoning without specific evidence, whereas the Opposition also uses principle-based critique without empirical data. Both lack specific evidence, but the Opposition provides a more nuanced critique of the principles involved.\n  \n- **Rebuttal Effectiveness:** The Opposition effectively undermines the Proposition's foundational claim by highlighting potential flaws in equating equal coverage with fairness.\n  \n- **Clash Winner:** **Opposition** wins this clash as they successfully challenge the fundamental assumption of the Proposition's argument.\n\n**Clash 2: Effectiveness of Guaranteed Response Segments**\n\n- **Proposition Quote:** \"The provision of guaranteed response segments directly addresses the problem of potential misrepresentation and biased reporting. By giving parties the opportunity to immediately clarify their position and correct inaccuracies, we prevent the spread of misinformation and promote a more accurate understanding of their platforms.\"\n  \n- **Opposition Quote:** \"The evidence provided fails to prove that guaranteed response segments are effective or necessary. The 2020 Reuters Institute study cited does not establish a causal link between misrepresentation and the lack of response segments.\"\n\n- **Logical Validity:** The Proposition argues for a preventive measure against misinformation, while the Opposition questions the sufficiency and applicability of the evidence provided.\n  \n- **Quality of Evidence:** The Proposition cites specific instances and sources (e.g., Politifact, Press Gazette), providing a higher quality of evidence. The Opposition critiques the evidence's sufficiency but does not offer alternative supporting evidence.\n  \n- **Rebuttal Effectiveness:** The Opposition effectively challenges the relevance and adequacy of the Proposition's evidence, casting doubt on the necessity of the proposed segments.\n  \n- **Clash Winner:** **Opposition** wins this clash by successfully questioning the effectiveness and necessity of the Proposition's evidence.\n\n**Clash 3: Voluntary Fairness Codes vs. Mandatory Regulations**\n\n- **Proposition Quote:** \"Relying on voluntary fairness codes and media watchdog guidelines has proven insufficient, as evidenced by consistent complaints of bias in major news outlets.\"\n  \n- **Opposition Quote:** \"There is strong evidence that voluntary measures and media watchdogs can be effective when properly implemented. Studies such as the 2022 European Journalism Observatory report show that self-regulatory bodies in countries like Germany and Sweden have successfully enforced fairness standards without government intervention.\"\n\n- **Logical Validity:** The Proposition argues that voluntary measures are inherently flawed, while the Opposition provides counter-evidence showcasing successful implementations of such measures.\n  \n- **Quality of Evidence:** Both sides present specific reports and studies, but the Opposition provides evidence of effective voluntary measures, directly countering the Proposition's claims.\n  \n- **Rebuttal Effectiveness:** The Opposition effectively neutralizes the Proposition's argument by presenting successful cases of voluntary measures, weakening the Proposition's stance.\n  \n- **Clash Winner:** **Opposition** wins this clash by offering compelling evidence that voluntary measures can be effective.\n\n**I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact**\n\n- **Proposition's Core Arguments:** Ensuring an informed electorate through equal coverage; countering misinformation with response segments; leveling the playing field for smaller parties.\n  \n- **Opposition's Core Arguments:** Fairness isn't synonymous with equal time; guaranteed response segments lack proven effectiveness; voluntary measures can be effective when properly implemented.\n  \n- **Logical Links:** The Opposition's arguments directly target the foundational claims of the Proposition, effectively dismantling the logical structure supporting the Proposition's case.\n  \n- **Impact Assessment:** The Opposition's ability to challenge the core principles and evidence of the Proposition significantly undermines the overall effectiveness of the Proposition's arguments, making their case less impactful.\n\n**I.3 Consistency and Contradictions**\n\n- **Proposition:** Maintains consistency in advocating for mandatory equal coverage and response segments without internal contradictions.\n  \n- **Opposition:** Consistently opposes the Proposition's measures by challenging their fairness, effectiveness, and reliance on voluntary codes without introducing contradictory arguments.\n  \n- **Dropped Arguments:** Both sides adequately address their respective positions without significant dropped arguments.\n\n**II. Evaluation Requirements**\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides present their strongest possible arguments. The Opposition fully contends with the Proposition's claims without misrepresenting them.\n  \n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The decision is based solely on the presented arguments, without introducing external knowledge.\n  \n- **Ignore Presentation:** Focus remains on argument substance, disregarding any rhetorical styles.\n  \n- **Framework Neutrality:** Both sides operate within their frameworks without conflicting evaluation criteria.\n\n**III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID**\n\n- **No Intervention:** The analysis strictly adheres to the arguments presented without introducing new points.\n  \n- **Balanced Burden of Proof:** Both sides are held to the same standard in proving their claims.\n  \n- **Avoidance of Over-Reliance on Real-World Arguments:** Real-world examples are evaluated based on their relevance and validity, not overly favored.\n  \n- **Addressing Dropped Arguments:** Both sides have comprehensively addressed their positions without notable omissions.\n  \n- **Preventing Double-Counting:** Each argument is evaluated once without repetitive consideration.\n  \n- **Assuming Causation from Correlation:** The analysis critically examines causal claims, ensuring they are substantiated.\n\n**IV. Decision Making**\n\n- **Winner:** **Opposition**\n  \n- **Confidence Level:** **75**\n  \n- **Key Factors:**\n  1. **Clash on Fairness:** The Opposition effectively challenged the Proposition's foundational claim that equal coverage equates to fairness.\n  2. **Effectiveness of Response Segments:** The Opposition successfully questioned the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed response segments.\n  3. **Voluntary Measures Evidence:** The Opposition provided compelling evidence that voluntary fairness codes can be effective, directly countering the Proposition's stance.\n\n- **Detailed Reasoning:** The Opposition consistently undermined the Proposition's core arguments by challenging the validity of equating equal coverage with fairness, questioning the effectiveness of guaranteed response segments, and presenting evidence that voluntary measures can be successfully implemented. These challenges significantly weakened the Proposition's case, tipping the balance in favor of the Opposition.\n\n**V. Line-by-Line Justification**\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** Presented three core arguments advocating for mandatory equal coverage and response segments, emphasizing democratic principles and evidence of media bias.\n  \n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** Mirrored the Proposition's structure but supported similar claims, likely intending to present opposing viewpoints through structured argumentation.\n  \n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** Addressed the Opposition's critiques by challenging their principles and evidence, reinforcing the need for the proposed policy.\n  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** Critiqued the Proposition's principles and evidence, arguing for the sufficiency of voluntary measures and questioning the practicality of the proposed mandates.\n  \n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** Framed the debate around media fairness and the necessity of the policy, reiterating core arguments and responding to Opposition's points.\n  \n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** Reinforced key clashes, emphasizing the practicality and effectiveness of voluntary measures, and undermined the Proposition's policy as unnecessary and potentially harmful.\n\n---"

The Proposition advocates for mechanisms to prevent misinformation, while the Opposition questions the necessity and effectiveness of such mechanisms.\n\n- **Quality of Evidence:**\n  - **Proposition:** Provides specific instances where lack of response segments led to misinformation.\n  - **Opposition:** Critiques the cited studies as insufficient and suggests existing mechanisms are adequate.\n\n- **Rebuttals Effectiveness:**\n  - **Proposition:** Emphasizes the potential of response segments to prevent misinformation.\n  - **Opposition:** Successfully questions the reliability and relevance of the Proposition\u2019s evidence.\n\n- **Clash Winner:** **Opposition**\n  \n  **Justification:** The Opposition effectively challenges the necessity of guaranteed response segments by casting doubt on the evidence provided and suggesting that existing measures may suffice, thereby weakening the Proposition\u2019s argument.\n\n#### Clash 3: Voluntary vs. Mandatory Measures\n\n- **Proposition Statement:** \"Relying on voluntary fairness codes and media watchdog guidelines is insufficient to ensure balanced coverage.\"\n  \n- **Opposition Statement:** \"There is strong evidence that voluntary measures and media watchdogs can be effective when properly implemented.\"\n\n- **Logical Validity:** The Proposition argues for mandatory measures due to perceived inadequacies in voluntary systems, while the Opposition defends the efficacy of voluntary measures with counter-evidence.\n\n- **Quality of Evidence:**\n  - **Proposition:** Points to specific failures of voluntary measures.\n  - **Opposition:** Cites studies and examples where voluntary measures have been effective in other countries.\n\n- **Rebuttals Effectiveness:**\n  - **Proposition:** Argues that voluntary measures lack enforcement and consistency.\n  - **Opposition:** Effectively presents successful cases, undermining the Proposition\u2019s claims about the ineffectiveness of voluntary systems.\n\n- **Clash Winner:** **Opposition**\n  \n  **Justification:** The Opposition provides robust evidence of successful voluntary measures in various countries, effectively countering the Proposition\u2019s argument about the insufficiency of such systems.\n\n### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n- **Proposition\u2019s Core Arguments:**\n  1. Mandatory equal coverage ensures an informed electorate and healthier democracy.\n  2. Guaranteed response segments promote accountability and reduce misinformation.\n  3. The policy levels the playing field for smaller parties, fostering political pluralism.\n\n- **Opposition\u2019s Core Arguments:**\n  1. Fairness does not equate to equal coverage; quality discourse is paramount.\n  2. Guaranteed response segments lack proven effectiveness and may be unnecessary.\n  3. Voluntary measures and media watchdogs can effectively ensure balanced coverage.\n\n- **Hierarchy and Impact:**\n  - The primary clashes (Fairness and Mandatory vs. Voluntary Measures) are central to the debate\u2019s resolution.\n  - The Opposition\u2019s ability to effectively challenge the core arguments of the Proposition diminishes the overall strength of the Proposition\u2019s case.\n\n### I.3 Weighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments\n\n- **Principled Arguments:**\n  - **Proposition:** Focuses on democratic principles of equitable access and informed electorate.\n  - **Opposition:** Emphasizes the principle of quality discourse over rigid equality.\n\n- **Practical Arguments:**\n  - **Proposition:** Argues that mandatory measures prevent media bias and misinformation.\n  - **Opposition:** Points out practical limitations and potential unintended consequences of mandatory measures, advocating for the effectiveness of voluntary systems.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The Opposition\u2019s practical arguments about the effectiveness and implementation of voluntary measures carry more weight due to robust supporting evidence.\n  - The Proposition\u2019s principled stance is undermined by the Opposition\u2019s effective practical challenges.\n\n### I.4 Consistency and Contradictions\n\n- **Proposition:**\n  - Maintains a consistent stance on the necessity of mandatory measures without internal contradictions.\n  \n- **Opposition:**\n  - Consistently argues for the efficacy of voluntary measures and challenges the necessity of mandates without contradicting themselves.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Both teams maintain consistency in their arguments, with no internal contradictions noted.\n\n## II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both teams have presented their arguments in strong forms. The Proposition emphasized democratic principles and evidence of media bias, while the Opposition robustly defended voluntary measures with international examples.\n  \n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The decision is based solely on the arguments presented within the debate, without introducing external opinions.\n\n- **Ignore Presentation:** The focus remains on the substance of the arguments, disregarding any rhetorical styles.\n\n- **Framework Neutrality:** Both sides operate within their frameworks effectively, with the Opposition successfully challenging the Proposition\u2019s framework.\n\n## III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\n- **Intervention:** No external arguments or evidence were introduced.\n  \n- **Shifting the Burden of Proof:** Both sides presented their cases without unjustly shifting burdens.\n\n- **Over-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** Both principled and practical arguments were equally considered.\n\n- **Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** All presented arguments were addressed in the analysis.\n\n- **Double-Counting:** Each argument was evaluated distinctly without redundancy.\n\n- **Assuming Causation from Correlation:** Arguments were critically assessed for logical soundness without assuming causation from mere correlation.\n\n- **Not Justifying Clash Decisions:** Each clash decision is explicitly justified with analysis.\n\n## IV. Decision Making\n\n- **Winner:** **Opposition**\n\n- **Confidence Level:** **80**\n\n  **Explanation:** The Opposition effectively challenged the Proposition\u2019s core arguments across all major clashes, providing robust evidence and logical reasoning that undermined the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed mandates. Their consistent and well-supported defenses outweighed the Proposition\u2019s principled but less substantiated claims.\n\n- **Key Factors:**\n  1. **Clash 1:** Opposition's redefinition of \"fairness\" successfully undermined the Proposition\u2019s foundational argument.\n  2. **Clash 3:** Strong evidence from the Opposition about the effectiveness of voluntary measures significantly weakened the Proposition\u2019s case.\n  3. **Clash 2:** Effective critique of the necessity and efficacy of guaranteed response segments further diminished the Proposition\u2019s position.\n\n- **Detailed Reasoning:** The Opposition systematically dismantled the Proposition\u2019s arguments by redefining key principles and providing substantial evidence that voluntary measures can be effective. Their ability to challenge the necessity of mandatory equal coverage and response segments, paired with successful counter-evidence regarding media watchdogs, provided a compelling case that the current system, with appropriate reforms, is sufficient. The Proposition\u2019s arguments, while grounded in democratic principles, lacked the empirical support needed to outweigh the Opposition\u2019s practical and evidence-based challenges.\n\n## V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** Presented three core arguments emphasizing democratic principles, accountability, and leveling the playing field for smaller parties.\n\n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** Countered each Proposition argument by redefining fairness, questioning the effectiveness of response segments, and defending voluntary measures with supporting evidence.\n\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** Attempted to undermine the Opposition\u2019s critiques by highlighting flaws in their principles and evidence but was effectively countered by the Opposition.\n\n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** Strengthened their initial arguments by providing additional evidence and addressing potential vulnerabilities in the Proposition\u2019s case.\n\n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** Reiterated the importance of equitable access and response mechanisms but was overshadowed by the Opposition\u2019s stronger counterarguments.\n\n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** Consolidated their position by reinforcing key clashes, emphasizing the practicality and effectiveness of voluntary measures, and highlighting the risks of the Proposition\u2019s mandates.\n\n<head>\n<winnerName>opposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>80</confidence>\n</head>"
