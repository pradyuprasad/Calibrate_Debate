    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "## OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\n**Introduction**\n\nGood morning, everyone. We stand before you today to affirm the motion: This House would require G20 nations to participate in a unified carbon trading market with cross-border credit trading and quarterly auctions, rather than allowing each nation to implement its own domestic carbon tax system. We believe that a unified carbon market offers a more effective, efficient, and equitable solution to reducing global carbon emissions compared to fragmented national carbon tax systems.\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\n\n*   **Core Claim:** A unified carbon trading market ensures greater efficiency in emissions reduction by directing investment to the most cost-effective abatement opportunities globally.\n*   **Support Type:** EVIDENCE\n*   **Support Details:**\n\n    *   **Example: European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).** A study by the European Commission found that the EU ETS has reduced emissions from power plants and industry by approximately 35% since 2005. However, its fragmented nature, with different phases and national allocation plans, has limited its potential. A unified G20 market would eliminate such inefficiencies.\n    *   **Example: California and Quebec Cap-and-Trade System.** The linking of California and Quebec's carbon markets has demonstrated the benefits of cross-border trading, leading to lower compliance costs and greater emissions reductions than either system could have achieved independently. This system saw a 16% decline in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2000 levels, by 2017.\n    *   **Numerical Evidence:** Modeling by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that a globally coordinated carbon price could reduce global emissions by 23% more than uncoordinated national carbon taxes while also generating significant revenue.\n*   **Connection:** These examples demonstrate how a single, larger carbon market can find and exploit low-cost abatement opportunities, pushing investment towards the most efficient projects, reducing the overall cost of decarbonization for G20 countries. A carbon tax, nationally done, will have less effect as the problem that we are discussing is global.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\n\n*   **Core Claim:** A unified carbon market promotes greater equity and prevents carbon leakage, where emissions-intensive industries relocate to countries with weaker regulations.\n*   **Support Type:** PRINCIPLE\n*   **Support Details:**\n\n    *   **Principle:** The \"Polluter Pays\" principle dictates that those responsible for pollution should bear the costs of managing it. A unified carbon market ensures that all G20 nations internalize the cost of their emissions, preventing free-riding and unfair competition.\n    *   **Explanation:** When countries have differing carbon tax rates, industries may relocate to countries with lower rates, simply shifting emissions rather than reducing them globally. This is carbon leakage. A unified market, through a carbon price, reduces the incentives for such leakage.\n    *   **Application:** A unified market with cross-border credit trading allows for a standardized price, enabling developing G20 countries to benefit from selling carbon credits to developed nations investing in carbon reduction technologies. This transfers wealth to developing nations and ensures that countries like China or India can continue to grow while still contributing to global emissions goals.\n*   **Connection:** This establishes that the principle of the polluter pays is only efficiently and equally enforced through a unified trading market since this would ensure that there is limited ability for companies to move to areas that have less strict regulations. This ensures that emissions are truly reduced. It also allows developed countries to invest in emissions reductions in developing countries through carbon credits.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n\nOur arguments demonstrate that a unified carbon trading market is superior to individual national carbon tax systems. The unified market will, more efficiently, find investment into countries that need it the most by finding the biggest carbon outputs at the lowest price of mitigation. It also enforces the polluter pays principle equally, incentivizing global, not local, reductions. By supporting the growth of all states in the G20. Without a global coordinated response the impact of climate change will continue to disproportionately affect developing nations, and as such, there is an undeniable need for a global response to this crisis.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "## REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe opposition's arguments, while seemingly well-structured, ultimately fail to address the core benefits of a unified carbon market and exaggerate the challenges it might face. We will demonstrate how their concerns are either overblown or can be effectively managed within a unified framework.\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\n\n*   **Original Claim:** \"A unified carbon trading market among G20 nations would create inefficiencies and economic disparities due to varying national circumstances.\"\n*   **Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n*   **Challenge:** The opposition's reliance on the principle of subsidiarity is misplaced in this context. Climate change is an inherently global problem requiring global solutions. While national circumstances do vary, the fundamental need to reduce emissions remains constant across all G20 nations. The principle of subsidiarity argues that decisions should be made at the lowest possible political level, however, climate change necessitates a decision to be made at the global political level. A unified market doesn't ignore national circumstances; it sets a common goal\u2014emission reduction\u2014and allows countries to achieve it through a market-based mechanism that efficiently allocates resources. A unified market ensures that the costs of carbon emissions are consistent across participating countries by setting a carbon price and ensuring compliance towards a global environmental aim.\n*   **Impact:** By insisting on prioritizing national circumstances above a unified approach, the opposition risks perpetuating a fragmented system that is less effective at reducing global emissions. By creating a consistent carbon price, it will mean that the companies will be disincentivized to relocate, and will actively change their practices to stay afloat.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n*   **Original Claim:** \"A unified carbon market would create geopolitical tensions and enforcement challenges.\"\n*   **Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence\n*   **Challenge:** While the opposition points to issues within the EU ETS, this is not a reason to dismiss the potential of a G20 unified market. Rather, it highlights the need for robust design and enforcement mechanisms from the outset. The EU ETS example is not directly comparable. VAT fraud, while a concern, can be mitigated through modern anti-fraud mechanisms. A properly designed G20 system, with standardised regulation against illegal activity in the carbon trading market, and an incentive structure between countries to cooperate and meet global emission targets, would provide an efficient mechanism. Moreover, rather than voluntary national commitments, a G20 agreement would require a binding commitment from the G20 block.\n*   **Impact:** By exaggerating the enforcement challenges and geopolitical concerns, the opposition overlooks the potential for a well-designed unified market to drive significant emissions reductions. It is key to remember here that G20 nations cause 80% of global emissions, and by implementing this resolution, there is significant potential for emissions reduction. It will also set an example for the rest of the world in terms of what the roadmap should look like to tackle this global crisis.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n*   **Original Claim:** \"A domestic carbon tax system is more effective at reducing emissions because it allows for tailored policy design.\"\n*   **Challenge Type:** Evidence critique\n*   **Challenge:** The opposition's example of Sweden's carbon tax is selective and ignores the limitations of isolated national efforts. While Sweden's tax has been successful, it operates within the context of the broader European Union, benefiting from EU-wide environmental regulations and market dynamics. The impacts of Sweden\u2019s carbon tax are also only effective within Sweden, and are ineffective in tackling the issue of carbon leakage, which is the primary issue with carbon tax systems. A domestic carbon tax might be tailored but is only locally effective since companies can move elsewhere. Without a broader international framework, the impact of national carbon taxes is limited and can lead to carbon leakage, undermining global efforts.\n*   **Impact:** The opposition's reliance on the Sweden example fails to acknowledge the need for coordinated action to address climate change effectively. This is a global problem that needs a global problem, in order to ensure equal enforcement.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\nVulnerabilities:\n- Our arguments rely on the assumption that G20 nations can agree on a unified market design, which may be challenging in practice.\n- The opposition may raise concerns about the initial economic burden on developing nations within the G20.\n- They may also highlight the difficulty of accurately pricing carbon and preventing market manipulation.\n\nAdditional Support:\n- We can cite examples of successful international agreements, such as the Montreal Protocol, to demonstrate the feasibility of global cooperation on environmental issues.\n- We can propose mechanisms for providing financial and technical assistance to developing nations to ease the transition to a unified market.\n- We can advocate for independent monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to ensure market integrity and prevent manipulation.\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our responses directly address the opposition's concerns by showing that they are either overblown or can be effectively managed within a unified framework.\n- We provide evidence and reasoning to support our claims that a unified market is more efficient, equitable, and effective than fragmented national carbon tax systems.\n- We emphasize the importance of addressing climate change as a global problem requiring global solutions, rather than relying on isolated national efforts.\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreements revolve around the efficiency, equity, and feasibility of a unified carbon market versus individual national carbon tax systems.\n- The opposition's claims about economic disparities, geopolitical tensions, and enforcement challenges are critical points of contention.\n\nWhy We Win:\n- We win by demonstrating that the benefits of a unified market \u2013 greater efficiency, reduced carbon leakage, and enhanced equity \u2013 outweigh the potential challenges.\n- We effectively counter the opposition's claims about economic disparities, geopolitical tensions, and enforcement challenges by providing evidence and reasoning to support our counter-arguments.\n- We show that a unified market is essential for achieving significant emissions reductions and addressing climate change as a global problem.\n\nOverall Impact:\n- By winning on these key points, we prove that a unified carbon trading market is superior to individual national carbon tax systems.\n- This is essential to effectively and efficiently tackle climate change, providing a more equitable framework across the G20 compared to a fragmented national approach.\n\n",
      "closing": "## FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nCore Questions:\n- The fundamental issue in this debate is how best to reduce global carbon emissions efficiently, equitably, and effectively.\n- The key decisions that matter are whether a unified carbon trading market can overcome the challenges of implementation and enforcement, and whether it offers a superior approach to fragmented national carbon tax systems.\n- This debate should be evaluated based on which system is more likely to achieve significant, lasting reductions in global carbon emissions while promoting equity and economic growth.\n\nKEY CLASHES\n\n**CLASH 1: Efficiency and Implementation**\n*Quote:* Opp claims: \"A unified carbon trading market among G20 nations would create inefficiencies and economic disparities due to varying national circumstances.\" Prop claims: \"A unified carbon trading market ensures greater efficiency in emissions reduction by directing investment to the most cost-effective abatement opportunities globally.\"\n*Our Case Strength:*\n- Our evidence demonstrates that a unified market can direct investment to the most cost-effective abatement opportunities, reducing the overall cost of decarbonization. The EU ETS, despite its flaws, has reduced emissions. The California-Quebec system serves as a model for cross-border trading. The IMF modeling shows significant potential for emissions reductions in a globally coordinated system.\n- The opposition exaggerates the challenges of implementation. While the EU ETS faced issues, these were due to design flaws that can be avoided in a properly designed G20 system. Modern anti-fraud mechanisms, standardised regulation, and strong incentive structures can mitigate these challenges. We disagree that the California-Quebec system is not scaleable to G20 - obviously, it will be more difficult but not impossible, nations can work together.\n- We acknowledge that perfect implementation is unrealistic, but a flawed unified system is still better than completely uncoordinated national systems, which is what the other side is arguing for.\n*Their Response Gaps:*\n- They have not adequately addressed the potential for a well-designed unified market to drive significant emissions reductions. They fallaciously assume that because of issues that arise in smaller systems, an efficient system is not possible with a coordinated design. Instead, they take for granted the failures that arise when no effort to coordinate action across nations is taken.\n- They fail to account for the fact that modern systems have sophisticated mechanisms to avoid these failures.\n- They selectively focus on the limitations of the EU ETS while ignoring its successes and the potential benefits of a more robust system. We are happy to agree that a poorly designed system would be ineffective, but based on a well designed system, we could see an exponential impact in this field.\n*Crucial Impact:*\n- This clash is critical because it determines whether the G20 can effectively reduce emissions at the scale required to address climate change. A unified market offers the potential for greater efficiency than fragmented national carbon tax systems, leading to more rapid and cost-effective emissions reductions.\n- This directly leads to a limitation in global warming, which leads to a limitation in climate issues.\n\n**CLASH 2: Equity and Carbon Leakage**\n*Quote:* Opp claims: \"A unified carbon market promotes greater equity and prevents carbon leakage.\" Prop claims: \"A domestic carbon tax system is more effective at reducing emissions because it allows for tailored policy design.\"\n*Our Case Strength:*\n- We establish that the polluter pays principle is centrally enforced through our system in that there is a low chance of companies moving to another nation when there is universal enforcement.\n- The opposition\u2019s focus on domestic circumstances ignores the broader issue of global carbon leakage. Without a unified market, industries will relocate to countries with weaker regulations, undermining global efforts to reduce emissions, as carbon taxes alone cannot account for this effect.\n- Also, our plan allows for the richer countries to easily transfer wealth to poorer companies, creating an incentive for all countries to cooperate to reduce pollution. This is a tangible outcome of a market with carbon trade.\n*Their Response Gaps:*\n- They have not adequately addressed the issue of carbon leakage. Their reliance on individual national efforts ignores the interconnectedness of the global economy and the ease with which industries can relocate.\n- They downplay the importance of a standardized carbon price in ensuring that all G20 nations internalize the cost of their emissions. This is important, because by the principles of the debate, it will ensure that there is an equal framework.\n*Crucial Impact:*\n- This clash is critical because it determines whether the G20 can equitably address climate change while preventing carbon leakage. A unified market ensures that all nations contribute to emissions reductions and incentivizes investment in clean technologies in developing countries.\n\n**CLASH 3: Tailored Policy vs. Coordinated Action**\n*Quote:* Opp claims: \"A domestic carbon tax system is more effective at reducing emissions because it allows for tailored policy design.\" Prop claims: \"Climate change is an inherently global problem requiring global solutions.\"\n*Our Case Strength:*\n- We demonstrated that climate change is a global crisis that needs an equal global enforcement.\n- The opposition's example of Sweden's carbon tax is limited and operates within the context of broader European Union regulations and does nothing to tackle the issue of carbon leakage. We are looking to take the EU's success with the ETS and ramp it up across the G20 to account for these issues.\n*Their Response Gaps:*\n- By relying on this example, they fail to acknowledge the need for coordinated action to address climate change effectively.\n- They exaggerate the benefits of tailored policy design while ignoring the need for a unified approach to ensure equitable and effective emissions reductions.\n*Crucial Impact:*\n- A global approach can address this issue better in the long run.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\nPriority Analysis:\n- The most important clash is the one about enforcement. Because, unless we have a solid framework, every effort will be useless since nations can go behind the scenes.\n- The second most important clash is effectiveness, since, in the end, what we must do is reduce emissions.\n- The final most important clash is equity.\n\nCase Proof:\n- By winning these key clashes, we prove that a unified carbon trading market is the superior approach to reducing global carbon emissions. Our arguments demonstrate that it is more efficient, equitable, and effective than fragmented national carbon tax systems. This directly proves the motion.\n\nFinal Weighing:\n- Any losses on minor points do not undermine our case because the core benefits of a unified market outweigh the potential challenges. Our ability to drive significant emissions reductions, promote equity, and prevent carbon leakage makes a compelling case for voting in favour of the motion.\n- We have proved that this helps drive global emissions more effectively, and even if the oppositions' minor points were true, it cannot defeat this objective.\n\n"

A one-size-fits-all market would fail to address these differences, leading to disproportionate economic burdens on developing nations or those with carbon-intensive industries.  \n**Connection:** Since G20 nations have vastly different economic and environmental realities, a unified system would undermine the effectiveness of carbon reduction efforts by forcing nations into an inflexible framework that does not accommodate their unique needs. This violates the subsidiarity principle and would lead to inefficiencies.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** A unified carbon market would create geopolitical tensions and enforcement challenges.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:** The European Union\u2019s Emission Trading System (ETS), the largest carbon market in the world, has faced significant issues with fraud, oversupply of credits, and enforcement discrepancies across member states. For example, in 2011, the EU ETS suffered a \u20ac5 billion VAT fraud due to cross-border trading loopholes. Additionally, the Paris Agreement relies on voluntary national commitments, and enforcing a unified market would require unprecedented international cooperation, which is unlikely given the G20\u2019s divergent interests.  \n**Connection:** These real-world examples demonstrate that even within a relatively cohesive bloc like the EU, carbon markets face serious operational and enforcement challenges. Scaling this to the G20, which includes geopolitical rivals like the U.S., China, and Russia, would exacerbate these issues, making the system unworkable.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** A domestic carbon tax system is more effective at reducing emissions because it allows for tailored policy design.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:** Sweden\u2019s carbon tax, implemented in 1991, has been highly successful, reducing emissions by 26% while GDP grew by 78%. The success is attributed to its ability to adapt to local industries and social needs. Conversely, a unified carbon market would remove this flexibility, as nations would be forced to conform to a standardized system.  \n**Connection:** This example shows that domestic carbon taxes can be both economically and environmentally effective when tailored to national contexts. A unified market would strip away this adaptability, making it less effective in achieving emission reductions.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nA unified carbon trading market among G20 nations would fail on multiple fronts: it would create inefficiencies by ignoring the subsidiarity principle, it would face insurmountable geopolitical and enforcement challenges, and it would be less effective than domestic carbon taxes in reducing emissions. Domestic carbon taxes allow nations to design policies that align with their unique economic and environmental circumstances, making them a superior solution. The real-world impact of this approach is clear\u2014nations like Sweden have demonstrated the effectiveness of tailored policies, while a unified market would likely lead to inequities and operational failures. Therefore, G20 nations should retain the flexibility to implement their own domestic carbon tax systems.\n\n---\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "REBUTTAL STRUCTURE\n\nCLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: \"A unified carbon trading market ensures greater efficiency in emissions reduction by directing investment to the most cost-effective abatement opportunities globally.\"\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge:\n  - The EU ETS example is flawed because it ignores the system's well-documented inefficiencies, including oversupply of credits which led to carbon prices crashing to \u20ac2.73 per ton in 2013, rendering it ineffective.\n  - The California-Quebec system is not scalable to G20; these are two highly aligned jurisdictions, not 20 diverse nations with competing interests.\n  - The IMF modeling assumes perfect implementation which is unrealistic given the geopolitical realities of G20 nations.\nImpact: Undermining this claim is crucial because it's the foundation for their efficiency argument. If their evidence falls apart, their entire case for a unified market collapses.\n\nCLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"A unified carbon market promotes greater equity and prevents carbon leakage.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge:\n  - Present evidence from the OECD (2022) showing that even within the EU's unified market, carbon leakage has continued at 10% of total emissions because industries relocate outside the trading bloc.\n  - The World Bank (2021) reports that developing nations often get locked out of carbon credit trading due to complex regulations, disproving their equity claims.\n  - Evidence from India shows that a well-designed domestic carbon tax (currently under consideration) could raise $250 billion for green investment while protecting local industries.\nImpact: This directly counters their equity and leakage claims, showing that their proposed system fails to achieve its stated goals in real-world applications.\n\nCLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: \"The 'Polluter Pays' principle is only enforced through a unified trading market.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge:\n  - Present the \"Effective Implementation\" principle: Environmental policies succeed when tailored to local contexts through proper implementation at the national level.\n  - A domestic carbon tax can better enforce the polluter pays principle by adapting to local industries' ability to pay and reinvesting revenues locally.\n  - The principle of \"Sovereign Policy Design\" allows nations to balance economic growth and emissions reductions in ways a unified market cannot.\nImpact: This establishes that alternative principles better serve the debate's objectives, making their principle claim less compelling.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- They may argue that domestic systems create loopholes, but this ignores that unified systems have even larger enforcement gaps.\n- They might claim domestic systems lack coordination, but existing international agreements like the Paris Accord already provide coordination mechanisms.\nAdditional Support:\n- Highlight Canada's split approach: carbon tax for consumers, cap-and-trade for heavy industries, showing superior flexibility to a one-size-fits-all market.\n- Cite the UN Environment Programme (2023) stating \"nationally-determined carbon pricing systems are achieving real emissions reductions faster than international market mechanisms.\"\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our evidence is more recent and comes from broader, more credible sources.\n- Our principles better account for real-world implementation challenges.\n- Our analysis addresses both environmental and economic dimensions more comprehensively.\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The effectiveness of domestic vs. unified systems in reducing emissions.\n- The ability to prevent carbon leakage and ensure equity.\n- The principle that best guides international climate policy.\nWhy We Win:\n- We've shown that unified markets underperform in reducing emissions and create new problems.\n- Domestic systems have proven records of success and greater adaptability.\n- Our principles offer more realistic, implementable frameworks.\nOverall Impact:\nOur arguments demonstrate that domestic carbon tax systems are superior in achieving the motion's environmental and economic goals while respecting national sovereignty and economic realities.\n\n",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**  \nCore Questions:  \n1. Can a unified carbon trading market effectively address global emissions reduction needs?  \n2. Is a unified system more practical and equitable than domestic carbon taxes?  \n3. Does the motion provide the best framework for G20 nations to combat climate change?  \n\nKey Decisions:  \n- **Efficiency vs. Adaptability:** Should G20 nations prioritize a standardized system or tailored national solutions?  \n- **Implementation Feasibility:** Is a unified market realistically implementable given geopolitical realities?  \n- **Equity and Sovereignty:** How do we balance global environmental goals with national economic and developmental needs?  \n\nEvaluation Criteria:  \n- Effectiveness in reducing emissions  \n- Practicality and enforceability  \n- Economic equity and fairness across G20 nations  \n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Efficiency vs. Adaptability**  \nQuote: Proposition claims a unified market directs investment to the most cost-effective abatement opportunities globally. Opposition argues it creates inefficiencies by ignoring national circumstances.  \nOur Case Strength:  \n- **Principle of Subsidiarity:** Decisions should be made at the most local level to address specific needs. Climate change may be global, but emissions reduction strategies must adapt to local economic and energy systems.  \n- **Real-World Evidence:** Sweden\u2019s domestic carbon tax reduced emissions by 26% while growing GDP by 78%, demonstrating the success of tailored policies.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n- Proposition ignores the inefficiencies of unified systems, such as the EU ETS\u2019s oversupply of credits and crashing prices.  \n- Their claim that a unified market sets a common goal is insufficient; implementation matters, and their system lacks adaptability.  \nCrucial Impact:  \n- Winning this clash shows that domestic systems are more effective and practical, while their unified market risks inefficiency and impracticality.  \n\n**Clash 2: Implementation Feasibility**  \nQuote: Proposition argues a unified market can overcome geopolitical tensions through robust design. Opposition highlights the EU ETS\u2019s operational and enforcement challenges.  \nOur Case Strength:  \n- **Unified Markets Fail in Practice:** The EU ETS suffered from VAT fraud, oversupply of credits, and enforcement discrepancies. Scaling this to the G20, with nations like the U.S., China, and Russia, is unrealistic.  \n- **Geopolitical Tensions:** G20 nations have divergent interests, making binding commitments on a unified market politically unfeasible.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n- Proposition offers no concrete solutions to prevent fraud or ensure enforcement. Their claim of \u201crobust design\u201d is speculative and untested.  \n- They fail to address how G20 nations with conflicting priorities would agree on and enforce a unified framework.  \nCrucial Impact:  \n- Winning this clash proves their system is unworkable, while domestic systems allow nations to implement practical, enforceable policies.  \n\n**Clash 3: Equity and Sovereignty**  \nQuote: Proposition claims a unified market promotes equity by preventing carbon leakage and transferring wealth to developing nations. Opposition argues it creates economic disparities and undermines sovereignty.  \nOur Case Strength:  \n- **Domestic Systems Are More Equitable:** India\u2019s proposed domestic carbon tax could raise $250 billion for green investment while protecting local industries.  \n- **Unified Markets Exclude Developing Nations:** The World Bank (2021) reports that developing nations often get locked out of carbon credit trading due to complex regulations.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n- Proposition fails to address how a unified market would prevent exclusion of developing nations or ensure equitable wealth transfer.  \n- Their claim of \u201cequal enforcement\u201d ignores the economic disparities between G20 nations.  \nCrucial Impact:  \n- Winning this clash demonstrates that domestic systems better protect sovereignty and economic equity, while their unified market risks exacerbating inequalities.  \n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \nPriority Analysis:  \n- **Implementation Feasibility** is the most critical issue. Without a workable system, their proposal fails regardless of its theoretical benefits.  \n- **Equity and Sovereignty** is equally important, as the motion must ensure fairness and respect for national developmental needs.  \n- **Efficiency vs. Adaptability** reinforces why domestic systems are superior in achieving environmental goals.  \n\nCase Proof:  \n- We\u2019ve proven that domestic carbon taxes are more effective, practical, and equitable.  \n- Our evidence and principles directly counter their claims, showing why a unified market is unworkable and inferior.  \n\nFinal Weighing:  \n- Domestic systems reduce emissions effectively (Sweden, India).  \n- They avoid the geopolitical and enforcement challenges of unified markets.  \n- They respect national sovereignty and economic equity, ensuring a fair and adaptable approach to emissions reduction.  \n\nThe judge should prioritize these factors and vote Opposition.  \n\n****  \n****"

EU\u2019s documented failures and scalability limits of regional systems outweigh Proposition\u2019s optimistic assumptions.  \n\n**Clash 2: Carbon Leakage and Equity**  \n- **Proposition Position**: Unified markets prevent carbon leakage.  \n  - **Evidence**: IMF claims unified carbon taxes reduce leakage.  \n- **Opposition Position**: Leakage persists even in unified systems (OECD cites 10% leakage in EU). Carbon credit systems exclude developing nations (World Bank 2021).  \n  - **Evidence**: India\u2019s domestic carbon tax could raise $250B for green investment while protecting local industries.  \n  - **Fallacy**: Proposition assumes unified markets automatically include equity mechanisms (unproven).  \n  - **Rebuttal Effectiveness**:  \n    - Opp\u2019s OECD and World Bank data explicitly refute Prop\u2019s equity claims.  \n    - Prop fails to address how exclusion of developing nations would be avoided.  \n- **Winner**: Opposition. Real-world data shows unified markets do not prevent leakage and risk excluding developing countries, weakening equity claims.  \n\n**Clash 3: Tailored Policies vs. Global Unification**  \n- **Proposition Position**: Global solution is needed; domestic taxes allow carbon leakage.  \n- **Opposition Position**: Nation-specific policies (e.g., Sweden\u2019s 26% emissions reduction) are more effective.  \n  - **Evidence**: Canada\u2019s hybrid tax-trading system, UN Environment Programme\u2019s support for national systems.  \n  - **Fallacy**: Proposition\u2019s reliance on a single theory (global efficiency) ignores proven national successes.  \n  - **Rebuttal Effectiveness**:  \n    - Opposition provides replicated examples (Sweden, Canada) showing tailored policies work better, while Prop\u2019s rebuttal dismisses these as \u201cselective\u201d without counter-evidence.  \n- **Winner**: Opposition. Empirical success of flexible domestic policies outweighs theoretical benefits of unity.  \n\n---  \n### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact  \n- **Proposition Core Argument**: \u201cGlobal coordination via unified markets is necessary.\u201d  \n  - **Logical Links**: Weak. While linking \u201cglobal problem requires global solution\u201d is sound, it ignores practical feasibility.  \n  - **Impact**: Limited. Overestimates ability to implement unified systems without proof.  \n- **Opposition Core Argument**: \u201cLocal policies achieve better results pragmatically.\u201d  \n  - **Logical Links**: Strong. Tiesecd OECD, Sweden, and World Bank evidence directly to claims.  \n  - **Impact**: High. Demonstrates real-world effectiveness and equity outcomes.  \n- **Key Arguments**: Opposition\u2019s emphasis on feasibility (due to geopolitical tensions) and equity (via national policies) are most critical to the motion.  \n\n---  \n### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions  \n- **Dropped Argument**: Proposition\u2019s reliance on \u201cIMF modeling\u201d assumes perfect implementation, which Opposition never responds to explicitly.  \n  - **Impact**: Weakens Proposition\u2019s logical foundation, but Opposition\u2019s counter-evidence (OECD, World Bank) indirectly addresses this.  \n- **Opposition Consistency**: Continuously links scalability issues in unified systems to practical feasibility without contradictions.  \n\n---  \n### IV. Decision Making  \n**Winner: Opposition**  \n- **Confidence**: 85 (Clear Victory).  \n- **Key Factors**:  \n  1. **Feasibility of Implementation**: Opposition\u2019s evidence (EU fraud, geopolitical tensions) convincingly argues unified markets are unworkable at scale.  \n  2. **Equity and Practicality**: Sweden and India examples demonstrate that domestic policies achieve emissions reduction while protecting developing economies.  \n  3. **Carbon Leakage**: Even in unified systems like the EU, leakage persists\u2014undermining Proposition\u2019s core equity claim.  \n\n---  \n### V. Line-by-Line Justification  \n- **Prop 1**: EU ETS success is cited but undercut by Opp\u2019s evidence on its inefficiencies.  \n- **Opp 1**: Subsidiarity principle and Sweden\u2019s tax are central, directly countering Prop\u2019s global coordination argument.  \n- **Prop Rebuttal 1**: Argues design fixes for EU\u2019s flaws but lacks evidence; Opp defends scalability critique.  \n- **Opp Rebuttal 1**: OECD/World Bank data effectively rebuts equity and leakage claims.  \n- **Prop Final**: Lists core questions but fails to address lack of feasibility.  \n- **Opp Final**: Reiterates success of national policies and implementation gaps in unified systems, mirroring Opp\u2019s stronger evidence.  \n\n---  \n**Final Note**: Opposition\u2019s focus on real-world practicality and proven national policies outweighed Proposition\u2019s theoretical efficiencies."

Core Judging Principles\n\nI.1 Direct Clash Resolution:\n\nClash 1: Efficiency of Emissions Reduction\n\n* Proposition: \"A unified carbon trading market ensures greater efficiency in emissions reduction by directing investment to the most cost-effective abatement opportunities globally.\" (Prop 1)\n* Opposition: \"A unified carbon trading market among G20 nations would create inefficiencies and economic disparities due to varying national circumstances.\" (Opp 1)\n\nAnalysis:\n* Proposition's Logic:  Generally sound, arguing that a larger market allows for more efficient allocation of resources. However, they rely on an assumption that a unified market will automatically find these efficiencies, without fully addressing the complexities of implementation.\n* Proposition's Evidence: EU ETS and California-Quebec examples provide some support, but the Opposition successfully points out weaknesses (EU ETS inefficiencies, limited scalability of California-Quebec). The IMF modeling is strong evidence if it had not been rebutted by the assumption of perfect implementation.\n* Opposition's Logic:  Appeals to the principle of subsidiarity. Strong in asserting that national differences exist, but the Opposition doesn't fully explain why these differences necessarily prevent a unified market from functioning effectively.\n* Opposition's Evidence: Provides the example of Sweden's carbon tax, but this is challenged by the Proposition as being specific to Sweden and the EU.\n* Rebuttals: Proposition effectively addresses opposition by stating the EU ETS successes, and downplaying difficulties with California-Quebec. Opp then calls into question the perfect implementation assumption of the IMF, and effectively rebuts the proposition.\n* Evolution:  The initial arguments focused on theoretical efficiency vs. national circumstances. The debate shifted towards practical implementation challenges and the effectiveness of existing systems.\n\nClash Winner: Opposition. While both sides present valid points, the opposition wins on the effectiveness rebuttal with the point on IMF perfect implementation.\n\nClash 2: Equity and Carbon Leakage\n\n* Proposition: \"A unified carbon market promotes greater equity and prevents carbon leakage.\" (Prop 1)\n* Opposition: Implied through arguments against unified markets and for domestic taxes.\n\nAnalysis:\n* Proposition's Logic:  Sound argument that a unified system can prevent leakage.  The equity argument, however, is underdeveloped, relying on an assumption of automatic wealth transfer without specifying mechanisms.\n* Proposition's Evidence:  Limited direct evidence for equity claims. Relies on a theoretical assumption about transfer wealth in carbon pricing but doesn't establish it as a tangible effect.\n* Opposition's Logic:  Focuses on the potential for a unified market to exacerbate existing inequalities and undermine national sovereignty. Effective in identifying potential downsides but doesn't directly engage with the leakage argument.\n* Opposition's Evidence: World Bank (2021) report provides some evidence of developing nations exclusion from credit trades, undermining the equity case. Opposition did show leakage has continued at 10%, even through the EU's unified market\n* Rebuttals: Proposition failed to address the World Bank, and OECD reports, as well as failed to address exclusion of developing countries.\n* Evolution: The Proposition's equity argument remains largely theoretical.  The Opposition provides stronger real-world examples showcasing limitations and continued leakage. Focuses on disparities and challenges.\n\n\nClash Winner: Opposition. Opposition successfully challenges the equity and leakage claims with counter-evidence (World Bank, and OECD). The Proposition's theoretical arguments about wealth transfer were underdeveloped.\n\nClash 3: Tailored Policy vs. Coordinated Action\n\n* Proposition:  \"Climate change is an inherently global problem requiring global solutions.\" (Prop 1)\n* Opposition: \"A domestic carbon tax system is more effective at reducing emissions because it allows for tailored policy design.\" (Opp 1)\n\nAnalysis:\n* Proposition's Logic:  Logically sound assertion that a global problem requires a global solution. However, this doesn't inherently mean a *unified* solution is necessary, only that coordination is required.\n* Proposition's Evidence: Relies on the general urgency of climate change, but no specific evidence that any unified system is more likely to meet the challenges.\n* Opposition's Logic:   Focuses on the flexibility of domestic systems and national differences. Also addresses the feasibility of implementing any one scheme in so many different contexts.  Effective in outlining advantages of domestic systems regarding adaptibility.\n* Opposition's Evidence: Sweden's carbon tax example, but this is challenged by the Proposition as being specific and limited. Propositions' evidence is limited again.\n* Rebuttals: Proposition counters Sweden example, but the Opposition then points to the EU ETS challenges.\n* Evolution: The Proposition maintained the global nature of the problem. The Opposition continued to emphasize the effectiveness of local adjustments\n\nClash Winner: Opposition. Opposition successfully defends the flexibility argument, showing that Proposition has not proven that the scope of the problem necessitates a unified system rather than a coordinated system.\n\nI.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact:\n\n* Proposition Core Argument: A unified carbon market is the most efficient, equitable, and effective way to reduce global emissions.\n * Links:  Links between core argument and supporting claims are not always clear (e.g., the link between a single market and wealth transfer to developing nations).\n* Impacts:  Stated impact is lower global emissions.\n* Opposition Core Argument: Domestic carbon tax systems are more practical and effective given national circumstances and existing geopolitical realities.\n * Links: Clear and strong links between arguments about national differences, subsidiarity, and economic/environmental factors to domestic systems.\n* Impacts: Stated impacts are more effective emissions reductions, reduced economic disruption, and greater national control.\n\nRelative Importance of Core Arguments: The most central arguments are efficiency, equity, and feasibility.  The Proposition's claim that a unified market is intrinsically the most efficient and equitable is not fully substantiated and directly clash with the Opposition's points regarding subsidiarity and the value of adapted solutions.\n\nI.3 Consistency and Contradictions:\n\n* Proposition: Some internal inconsistency: Acknowledging the EU ETS flaws while simultaneously using it as evidence.\n* Opposition: Relatively consistent throughout.\n* Dropped Arguments: None.\n\nII. Evaluation Requirements (Met)\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID (Avoided)\n\nIV. Decision Making:\n\n* Winner: Opposition\n* Confidence Level: 75 \u2013 Opposition presented successfully challenges and provided counter examples.\n* Key Factors:\n    1. Opposition\u2019s effective rebuttals and counter-evidence regarding equity, efficiency, and implentation.\n    2. Opposition\u2019s cohesive case emphasizing practical challenges and national differences.\n    3. Proposition\u2019s over-reliance on theoretical claims and underdeveloped equity arguments.\n\nDetailed Reasoning:  The Opposition presented a consistent case, highlighting challenges of a unified market while defending domestic systems. They provided specific examples and countered evidence to prove the Proposition's key arguments were not entirely sound. The Propositions' failed to account for several rebuttals, highlighting a significant decline in their case, where the core of their argument was around efficiency, of which they failed to provide sufficient support, despite the EU ETS and California-Quebec systems existing, because they were directly rebutted each time. The Opposition focused on real-world evidence and addressed both arguments, as well as the major points of disagreement, successfully.\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\n\n* Prop 1:  Sets out the core arguments for a unified carbon market, emphasizing efficiency, equity, and preventing carbon leakage, citing examples of varying success.\n* Opp 1:  Argues against a unified market emphasizing national circumstances, geopolitical tensions, and the effectiveness of tailored domestic policies, using the Swedish model.\n* Prop Rebuttal 1:  Challenges the Opposition's arguments about subsidiarity and enforcement, defends the EU ETS, and Sweden Carbon Tax.\n* Opp Rebuttal 1: Critiques the Proposition's EU ETS and equity claims, offering counter-evidence and emphasizing real-world challenges.\n* Prop Final: Restates key clashes and their case strengths, focusing on emissions reductions, implementation challenges, and carbon leakage, claiming superiority.\n* Opp Final:  Focuses on the impracticality of a unified market, existing challenges, and the importance of national sovereignty and flexibility in achieving emissions reductions. \n"

Core Judging Principles\n\nI.1 Direct Clash Resolution\n\nClash 1: Efficiency and Implementation\n- Proposition: A unified carbon trading market ensures greater efficiency in emissions reduction by directing investment to the most cost-effective abatement opportunities globally. They cite the EU ETS, California-Quebec system, and IMF modeling as evidence.\n- Opposition: A unified carbon trading market among G20 nations would create inefficiencies and economic disparities due to varying national circumstances. They argue that the EU ETS had inefficiencies like oversupply of credits and that the California-Quebec system is not scalable to G20. They also question the IMF modeling's assumptions.\n- Analysis: The Proposition's evidence is strong but the Opposition raises valid concerns about scalability and implementation challenges. The Proposition's rebuttal that these issues can be mitigated through robust design is plausible but speculative. The Opposition's critique of the IMF modeling's assumptions is valid.\n- Winner: Opposition, as they effectively challenge the scalability and implementation feasibility of a unified G20 market.\n\nClash 2: Equity and Carbon Leakage\n- Proposition: A unified carbon market promotes greater equity and prevents carbon leakage. They argue it enforces the polluter pays principle globally and allows wealth transfer to developing nations through carbon credits.\n- Opposition: A unified carbon market would not effectively prevent carbon leakage or ensure equity. They cite OECD evidence of continued carbon leakage in the EU and World Bank reports of developing nations being locked out of carbon credit trading. They also present India's domestic carbon tax proposal as a better alternative.\n- Analysis: The Opposition's evidence effectively counters the Proposition's claims about equity and carbon leakage prevention. The Proposition's arguments rely on theoretical benefits that the Opposition shows are not realized in practice.\n- Winner: Opposition, as they provide strong evidence undermining the Proposition's equity and carbon leakage claims.\n\nClash 3: Tailored Policy vs. Coordinated Action\n- Proposition: Climate change is an inherently global problem requiring global solutions. They argue that domestic carbon taxes cannot address carbon leakage and that a unified approach is necessary.\n- Opposition: Domestic carbon tax systems are more effective because they allow for tailored policy design. They cite Sweden's successful carbon tax as evidence and argue that a unified market would lack necessary adaptability.\n- Analysis: The Proposition's argument about the need for global coordination is strong, but the Opposition effectively counters with evidence of successful domestic policies and the adaptability benefits of national systems.\n- Winner: Opposition, as they demonstrate the effectiveness of tailored domestic policies and the limitations of a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nI.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n- The key issues are efficiency, equity, and feasibility of implementation. The Opposition effectively challenges the Proposition on all three fronts, showing that domestic systems are more efficient, equitable, and feasible than a unified G20 market.\n\nI.3 Consistency and Contradictions\n- Both sides maintain consistent arguments throughout the debate. The Proposition's vulnerability is their reliance on theoretical benefits and assumptions about overcoming implementation challenges, which the Opposition effectively exploits.\n\nII. Evaluation Requirements\n- Steelmanning: Both sides' arguments were considered in their strongest form.\n- Argument-Based Decision: The decision is based solely on the arguments presented in the debate.\n- Ignore Presentation: Only the substance of arguments was considered.\n- Framework Neutrality: Both sides' frameworks were evaluated equally.\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n- No judging errors were committed. All arguments were evaluated based on the criteria in Section I.\n\nIV. Decision Making\n- The Opposition effectively challenged the Proposition's key arguments about efficiency, equity, and feasibility. They provided strong evidence and reasoning to support their case for domestic carbon tax systems over a unified G20 market.\n- The key factors were the Opposition's successful challenges to the scalability and implementation feasibility of a unified market, their evidence undermining the equity and carbon leakage prevention claims, and their demonstration of the effectiveness of tailored domestic policies.\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification\n- Proposition Opening Speech: Presented arguments for a unified market's efficiency and equity benefits, citing EU ETS, California-Quebec system, and IMF modeling.\n- Opposition Opening Speech: Argued that a unified market would create inefficiencies, geopolitical tensions, and be less effective than domestic carbon taxes, citing subsidiarity principle, EU ETS issues, and Sweden's carbon tax.\n- Proposition Rebuttal: Countered that climate change requires global solutions, implementation challenges can be mitigated, and domestic systems cannot address carbon leakage.\n- Opposition Rebuttal: Effectively challenged Proposition's evidence, presented counter-evidence on carbon leakage and equity, and argued for the superiority of domestic systems.\n- Proposition Closing Speech: Reiterated arguments about global solutions, efficiency, and equity, but failed to adequately address implementation challenges.\n- Opposition Closing Speech: Strongly reinforced arguments about domestic systems' effectiveness, feasibility, and equity, effectively countering Proposition's case.\n\n<winnerName>opposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>75</confidence>"

OECD reports 10% leakage in the EU, undermining efficiency.  \n- **Analysis**:  \n  - Prop\u2019s argument hinges on causal claims (e.g., \"directing investment\"), but the EU ETS\u2019s success might stem from external factors like EU-wide regulations, not just cross-border trading. The Opposition\u2019s critique highlights a **correlation/causation fallacy** in Prop\u2019s reliance on EU data.  \n  - Specificity: Opp\u2019s evidence (VAT fraud, price collapse, 10% leakage) is stronger because it directly undermines Prop\u2019s core example. IMF modeling\u2019s overemphasis on \"perfect implementation\" weakens its specificity.  \n  - Reliance on EU ETS as flawed but \"fixable\" is vague. Opp\u2019s rebuttal exposes that Prop\u2019s solutions (e.g., \"modern mechanisms\") are not grounded in concrete plans.  \n  - **Winner**: Opposition. They provided direct counter-evidence showing systemic flaws in the EU ETS, which prop cannot dismiss as merely \"design issues.\" The scalability critique is valid, as the California-Quebec model lacks the geopolitical diversity of the G20.  \n\n#### Clash 2 (Equity/Carbon Leakage):  \n- **Proposition Position**: \"A unified system prevents carbon leakage and promotes equity via cross-border credit trading.\"  \n    - Support: China/India can sell credits and \"Polluter Pays\" enforcement.  \n- **Opposition Position**: \"Unified approaches worsen carbon leakage and inequity; domestic taxes ensure economic fairness.\"  \n    - Support: OECD\u2019s 10% EU leakage despite ETS; World Bank notes developing nations locked out of trading due to complexity; India\u2019s domestic tax raising $250B.  \n- **Analysis**:  \n  - Proposition\u2019s equity claims rely on the *assumption* that developing nations can easily sell credits even with complex regulations\u2014a **straw man fallacy**, as Opp shows exclusion actually occurs.  \n  - Opp\u2019s counter-evidence (leakage persisting in EU systems, India\u2019s tax) is more specific and recent (2021-2023).  \n  - Carbon leakage remains unresolved in ETS, undermining Prop\u2019s core promise. Domestic taxes like Sweden\u2019s succeed without unified markets.  \n  - **Winner**: Opposition. They demonstrated leakage persists in real-world unified systems and equity is not achieved due to systemic barriers.  \n\n#### Clash 3 (Principle of Subsidiarity vs. Global Solutions):  \n- **Proposition Position**: \"Climate change requires global solutions, not local adaptation.\"  \n    - Support: Global crisis needs global enforcement.  \n- **Opposition Position**: \"Local policies are more effective because national circumstances differ.\"  \n    - Support: Subsidiarity principle; Sweden\u2019s success (26% reduction, 78% GDP growth); Canada\u2019s hybrid tax/trade system.  \n- **Analysis**:  \n  - Proposition\u2019s rejection of subsidiarity is a **principle vs. practical clash**, but Opp\u2019s evidence (Sweden, India) shows domestic policies address economic and environmental needs better than unified frameworks.  \n  - Pron\u2019s rebuttal conceded that the EU ETS\u2019s design was flawed (ignoring early warnings by Opp), then argued scalability without evidence. Opp countered this with OECD data.  \n  - **Winner**: Opposition. Their evidence and principles of tailored implementation beat Prop\u2019s theoretical benefits.  \n\n#### Track Evolution:  \n- **Proposition** shifted in rebuttal from praising EU ETS directly to arguing it could be \"repaired,\" weakening their case.  \n- **Opposition** emphasized scalability and implementational feasibility throughout, while **Proposition** failed to address concrete G20 collaboration strategies.  \n\n---\n\n### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact  \n#### Proposition\u2019s Core Argument:  \n- **Efficiency & Equity via Unified Market**: Connects reduced leakage, global pricing, and wealth transfer to emissions reduction (via IMF model). However, the evidence for causal efficiency is weak (flawed EU example), and equity claims are contradicted by World Bank/India data.  \n- **Impact**: Credibility relies on *assuming* systemic problems are solvable, but negligible evidence supports this.  \n\n#### Opposition\u2019s Core Argument:  \n- **Tailored Domestic Taxes**: Prioritizes local implementation (Sweden, Canada) and avoidance of global market flaws (fraud, leakage, exclusion).  \n- **Impact**: More likely to achieve emissions reductions without systemic failures, plus economic sovereignty and fairness.  \n\n#### Key Rankings:  \n1. **Implementation Challenges (Opposition\u2019s Clash 2)**: If the system is unworkable, all other benefits (e.g., efficiency) are irrelevant.  \n2. **Carbon Leakage/Equity (Opposition\u2019s Clash 3)**: Proven leakage rates and developing-country exclusion negate Polluter Pays success.  \n3. **Efficiency (Clash 1)**: Prop\u2019s claims are speculative vs. Opp\u2019s concrete evidence of failed precedents.  \n\n---\n\n### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions  \n- **Dropped Argument**: Proposition failed to address how a unified market would *prevent exclusion of developing nations from carbon credit trading* (Opp\u2019s World Bank 2021 evidence).  \n    - Initial Strength: High (Pron\u2019s equity claims are central).  \n    - Impact: Being unaddressed weakens pron\u2019s equity argument.  \n- **Proposition\u2019s Contradiction**: Their closing speech claims international cooperation is possible (referencing Montreal Protocol) but provides no evidence for G20 agreement dynamics, weakening their credibility.  \n\n---\n\n### II Evaluation Requirements  \n- **Steelman**: All arguments were analyzed in their strongest form (e.g., Prop\u2019s emphasis on *global problem-solving*).  \n- **Presentation Neutrality**: Ignored rhetorical elements (e.g., \u201cdundeniably need for a global response\u201d) and focused purely on argument validity.  \n- **Framework Neutrality**: Both sides\u2019 principles (subsidiarity vs. global enforcement) were fairly assessed; Opp provided superior evidence for their framework.  \n\n---\n\n### III Common Judging Errors Avoided  \n- **Not Assuming Causation**: Prop\u2019s efficiency claims (e.g., \"IMF suggests 23% more reductions\") required questioning of causal evidence, which Opp did effectively.  \n- **Ignoring Dropped Arguments**: Addressed the Prop\u2019s failure to counter the World Bank\u2019s exclusion of developing nations in Clash 3.  \n\n---\n\n### IV Decision Making  \n- **Winner**: Opposition  \n- **Confidence Level**: 80  \n    - A decisive win on equity and feasibility and a clear win on efficiency, but not a landslide due to Prop\u2019s theoretical merit on global solutions.  \n\n#### Key Factors:  \n1. **Feasibility of Implementation**: Opp\u2019s demonstration of EU ETS\u2019 fraud and price collapse (both specific, cited) showed that unified markets are inherently vulnerable to these challenges, which Prop\u2019s vague claims (e.g., \u201cmodern mechanisms\u201d) did not counter.  \n2. **Carbon Leakage**: OECD\u2019s 10% leakage rate disproved the claim that unified markets eliminate leakage, while Opp\u2019s Sweden/India examples showed domestic taxes reduce emissions without cross-border loopholes.  \n3. **Specificity of Evidence**: Opp\u2019s use of recent, real-world data (2021-2023) outweighed Prop\u2019s reliance on outdated or speculative sources (e.g., IMF\u2019s \u201cperfect implementation\u201d assumption).  \n\n#### Detailed Reasoning:  \nThe opposition\u2019s rebuttals decisively dismantled core prop advantages by demonstrating that even successful localized programs like Sweden operate within broader EU frameworks, and that unified systems (like the ETS) face intractable issues (oversupply, fraud, leakage) despite theoretical benefits. Prop\u2019s insistence that a \u201cwell-designed\u201d system would fix these issues is unconvincing without concrete mechanisms, and their IMF modeling assumes unrealistic cooperation dynamics. Conversely, Opp\u2019s practical examples (OECD leakage data, World Bank exclusion, Canada\u2019s hybrid system) provided stronger evidence that domestic taxes offer a proven, flexible, and equitable alternative. The principle of subsidiarity became critical because it directly addressed the motion\u2019s feasibility without needing to rely on unproven international agreements.  \n\n---\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification  \n#### **Proposition Opening Speech (Prop 1)**  \n- ARGUMENT 1\u2019s EU ETS example is countered (\u201coversupply caused price crashes,\u201d \u201cSweden\u2019s success tied to EU context\u201d).  \n- ARGUMENT 2\u2019s equity claims are undermined by World Bank exclusion data.  \n\n#### **Opposition Opening Speech (Opp 1)**  \n- ARGUMENT 1\u2019s subsidiarity critique is validated by Prop inability to address implementation flaws.  \n- ARGUMENT 2\u2019s EU ETS fraud/crash data directly weakens Prop\u2019s efficiency case.  \n- ARGUMENT 3\u2019s Sweden example and GDP growth ties to a domestic tax\u2019s adaptability are unaddressed by Prop.  \n\n#### **Proposition Rebuttal (Prop Rebuttal 1)**  \n- Prop\u2019s challenge to subsidiarity as \u201cinapplicable\u201d is rebuked by Opp\u2019s feasibility arguments and sovereign policy examples.  \n- CALIFORNIA-QUEBEC scalability critique remains unaddressed.  \n\n#### **Opposition Rebuttal (Opp Rebuttal 1)**  \n- OECD and World Bank evidence is uncontroverted, eroding Prop\u2019s equity and efficiency claims.  \n- India\u2019s carbon tax example undercuts Prop\u2019s \u201cpolluter pays\u201d enforcement strength.  \n\n#### **Proposition Closing Speech (Prop Final)**  \n- Reiterated efficiency and equity without providing new rebuttals to OECD/World Bank counter-evidence.  \n- Admitted \u201cflawed unified systems\u201d are better than \u201cuncoordinated national taxes,\u201d but Opp\u2019s evidence shows uncoordinated taxes *are* effective (Sweden).  \n\n#### **Opposition Closing Speech (Opp Final)**  \n- Emphasized implementation feasibility as determinative, which Prop could not disprove.  \n- UN data on nationally-determined systems beating unified markets is unchallenged.  \n- India and Canada\u2019s policies were not addressed by Prop, leaving their arguments uncontested.  \n- Global warming severity was Prop\u2019s only abstract impact, but Opp\u2019s arguments showed unified markets deliver worse results.  \n\nAll arguments/exchanges were evaluated under core criteria, with no double-counting or shifts in burden of proof."

Core Judging Principles\n\nI.1 Direct Clash Resolution:\n\nClash 1: Efficiency of Emissions Reduction\n\n* Proposition: \"A unified carbon trading market ensures greater efficiency in emissions reduction by directing investment to the most cost-effective abatement opportunities globally.\" (Prop 1)\n* Opposition: \"A unified carbon trading market among G20 nations would create inefficiencies and economic disparities due to varying national circumstances.\" (Opp 1)\n\nAnalysis:\nProposition uses EU ETS and California-Quebec systems as evidence, along with IMF modeling. However, Opposition effectively rebuts by pointing out EU ETS inefficiencies (oversupply of credits), limited scalability of California-Quebec, and unrealistic assumptions in IMF modeling (Opp Rebuttal). Proposition's attempt to defend these examples in the final speech (Prop Final) is weak and doesn't fully address the criticisms.  Opposition\u2019s use of the subsidiarity principle, while a valid point about local context, is somewhat less compelling than the practical challenges they raise regarding implementation.\n\nWinner: Opposition.  Opposition's rebuttals directly undermine the proposition's evidence, making their case for efficiency stronger.  Proposition fails to effectively address these criticisms. The track of the argument clearly shows the proposition's evidence weakening under scrutiny.\n\nClash 2: Equity and Carbon Leakage\n\n* Proposition: \"A unified carbon market promotes greater equity and prevents carbon leakage, where emissions-intensive industries relocate to countries with weaker regulations.\" (Prop 1)\n* Opposition: Implicit in their arguments about economic disparities and national circumstances (Opp 1, Opp Final)\n\nAnalysis:\nProposition argues a unified market prevents carbon leakage. Opposition counters with evidence of continued leakage within the EU and difficulties for developing nations in carbon credit trading (Opp Rebuttal).  Proposition's final speech reiterates the \"polluter pays\" principle but doesn't fully address the presented counter-evidence (Prop Final).\n\nWinner: Opposition.  Opposition provides stronger evidence directly challenging the proposition's claim about equity and leakage. The proposition offers a principled argument and some theoretical benefits but lacks the evidence to counter the more concrete challenges presented by the Opposition.\n\nClash 3: Domestic vs. Unified Systems\n\n* Proposition: A unified market is necessary for global solutions. (Prop 1, Prop Final)\n* Opposition: Domestic systems allow for tailored policy and better address local needs (Opp 1, Opp Final)\n\nAnalysis:\nOpposition uses the example of Sweden's successful carbon tax and argues for subsidiarity. Proposition criticizes Sweden's example as operating within a larger EU framework and being susceptible to leakage. However, Opposition provides additional support citing the UN Environment Programme\u2019s findings on the effectiveness of national systems (Opp Rebuttal).\n\nWinner: Opposition. While both sides make valid points, Opposition's argument for flexibility and tailored approaches resonates given the diverse circumstances of G20 nations. Their use of both principle (subsidiarity) and practical evidence (Sweden, UN report) makes a more compelling case.\n\n\nI.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact:\n\nProposition: Core argument is that a unified market is the most efficient and equitable way to reduce emissions.  The logical link to supporting claims is present but weakened by Opposition rebuttals.  The impact is reducing global emissions and mitigating climate change.\n\nOpposition:  Core argument is that domestic systems are more practical, effective, and equitable.  The logical links are generally strong and well-supported by evidence.  The impact is achieving emission reduction goals while respecting national sovereignty and economic needs.\n\n\nI.3 Consistency and Contradictions:\n\nNo major contradictions within either team\u2019s arguments are apparent.  The proposition slightly drops the specific criticisms to the Quebec-California example (Opp Rebuttal).  This argument had moderate initial strength due to illustrating cross-border trading, and lacking response does weaken their defense of the argument on efficiency somewhat.\n\n\nII. Evaluation Requirements (Met)\n\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID (Avoided)\n\n\n\nIV. Decision Making:\n\nWinner: Opposition\n\nConfidence Level: 75\n\nKey Factors:\n\n1. Opposition\u2019s strong rebuttals effectively undermined the proposition's key evidence regarding efficiency and equity, specifically challenging the EU ETS, California-Quebec examples, and IMF modeling.\n\n2.  Opposition convincingly argued that the complexities and geopolitical realities of the G20 make a unified market impractical and difficult to enforce.\n\n3. Opposition effectively used both principled arguments (subsidiarity, sovereignty) and practical evidence (Sweden, UN report) to support their case for domestic systems.\n\nDetailed Reasoning:\nWhile the proposition presented a reasonable case for the theoretical benefits of a unified market, the Opposition successfully exposed weaknesses in their evidence and offered compelling counter-arguments highlighting the practical challenges of implementation, enforcement, and potential inequities.  The Opposition's arguments resonated more strongly due to their focus on real-world complexities and the need for adaptable solutions tailored to national circumstances.  While  I steelmanned the proposition\u2019s arguments, the Opposition\u2019s case ultimately proved more persuasive.\n\n\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\n\n* Prop 1: The proposition's opening speech lays out the core arguments for a unified carbon market, focusing on efficiency, equity, and the \"polluter pays\" principle.\n* Opp 1: The opposition's opening speech introduces the principles of subsidiarity and evidence of challenges in the EU ETS, arguing for domestic systems.\n* Prop Rebuttal: The proposition challenges the opposition's claims regarding national circumstances, EU ETS effectiveness, and Sweden's carbon tax example.\n* Opp Rebuttal: The opposition provides more specific evidence criticizing the EU ETS, challenging equity claims, and introducing counter-principles.\n* Prop Final: The proposition reiterates core arguments, defends the feasibility of a unified market, and highlights carbon leakage concerns with national carbon taxes.\n* Opp Final: The opposition emphasizes practicality, enforceability, and equity advantages of domestic systems, and raises concerns about the geopolitical realities in G20.\n\n"

      "logic": "Here are my thoughts on the debate, organized according to the required format:\n\n---\n\n### I. Core Judging Principles\n\n#### I.1 Direct Clash Resolution\n\n**Clash 1: Efficiency of a Unified Carbon Market vs. National Carbon Taxes**  \n- **Proposition:** Argues that a unified carbon market ensures greater efficiency by directing investment to the most cost-effective abatement opportunities globally. Cites the EU ETS, California-Quebec system, and IMF modeling as evidence.  \n- **Opposition:** Claims that a unified market would create inefficiencies due to varying national circumstances, citing the principle of subsidiarity. Critiques the EU ETS for oversupply of credits and the California-Quebec system as non-scalable.  \n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s evidence is strong but relies on idealistic assumptions (e.g., perfect implementation). The Opposition effectively critiques the scalability and real-world inefficiencies of unified markets. The principle of subsidiarity is compelling, as it highlights the need for tailored solutions.  \n- **Winner:** Opposition. The critiques of the EU ETS and scalability issues undermine the Proposition\u2019s efficiency claims.\n\n**Clash 2: Equity and Carbon Leakage**  \n- **Proposition:** Claims a unified market promotes equity and prevents carbon leakage by enforcing the polluter pays principle and enabling cross-border credit trading.  \n- **Opposition:** Counters with evidence of carbon leakage within the EU ETS and argues that developing nations are often excluded from carbon credit trading. Presents India\u2019s domestic carbon tax as a more equitable solution.  \n- **Analysis:** The Opposition\u2019s evidence of carbon leakage and exclusion of developing nations is persuasive. The Proposition\u2019s equity claims are undermined by real-world examples.  \n- **Winner:** Opposition. The evidence of carbon leakage and exclusion of developing nations is decisive.\n\n**Clash 3: Tailored Policy vs. Coordinated Action**  \n- **Proposition:** Argues that climate change is a global problem requiring a unified approach. Critiques Sweden\u2019s carbon tax as limited in scope and ineffective against carbon leakage.  \n- **Opposition:** Emphasizes the success of Sweden\u2019s carbon tax and the principle of sovereign policy design, arguing that tailored policies are more effective.  \n- **Analysis:** The Opposition\u2019s example of Sweden\u2019s carbon tax is strong, and the principle of sovereign policy design is compelling. The Proposition\u2019s critique of carbon leakage is valid but less supported by evidence.  \n- **Winner:** Opposition. The success of tailored policies and the principle of sovereign design outweigh the Proposition\u2019s critique.\n\n#### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n- **Proposition\u2019s Core Arguments:** Efficiency, equity, and global coordination.  \n- **Opposition\u2019s Core Arguments:** Subsidiarity, implementation feasibility, and tailored policy design.  \n- **Analysis:** The Opposition\u2019s arguments are more grounded in real-world evidence and principles. The Proposition\u2019s arguments rely on idealistic assumptions and are less persuasive in the face of critiques.\n\n#### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions\n\n- **Proposition:** Consistent in advocating for a unified market but vulnerable to critiques of implementation feasibility.  \n- **Opposition:** Consistent in advocating for domestic carbon taxes and effectively critiques the Proposition\u2019s claims.  \n- **Dropped Arguments:** The Proposition does not adequately address the Opposition\u2019s evidence of carbon leakage and exclusion of developing nations.\n\n---\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides\u2019 arguments were presented in their strongest form.  \n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The decision is based solely on the arguments presented in the debate.  \n- **Framework Neutrality:** Both sides presented valid frameworks, and the debate was judged based on how well each side argued within their framework.\n\n---\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\n- No errors were committed. The analysis focused on logical validity, evidence quality, and rebuttal effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n### IV. Decision Making\n\n- **Winner:** Opposition. The Opposition effectively critiqued the Proposition\u2019s claims and provided stronger evidence and principles.  \n- **Confidence Level:** 75 (Clear Victory). The Opposition\u2019s critiques of implementation feasibility and equity were decisive.  \n- **Key Factors:**  \n  1. The Opposition\u2019s evidence of carbon leakage and exclusion of developing nations.  \n  2. The principle of subsidiarity and the success of tailored policies like Sweden\u2019s carbon tax.  \n- **Detailed Reasoning:** The Opposition\u2019s arguments were more grounded in real-world evidence and principles, while the Proposition\u2019s claims relied on idealistic assumptions and were effectively critiqued.\n\n---\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** Strongly argued for efficiency and equity but relied on idealistic assumptions.  \n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** Effectively critiqued unified markets and advocated for domestic carbon taxes.  \n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** Attempted to address critiques but did not fully counter the Opposition\u2019s evidence.  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** Strongly critiqued the Proposition\u2019s evidence and principles.  \n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** Reiterated core arguments but did not adequately address critiques.  \n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** Effectively summarized key clashes and reinforced the case for domestic carbon taxes.\n\n---\n\n<winnerName>opposition</winnerName>  \n<confidence>75</confidence>"

It's a blank slate on clash.\n*   **Evidence Quality:** The speech mixes evidence and principle. The EU ETS point is decent evidence. The California-Quebec point is also good. The IMF point is also pretty good. Overall, evidence is reasonably strong.\n*   **Logical Validity:** The logical leaps are reasonably warranted. The explanation of efficiency and equity are solid. The carbon leakage argument is valid.\n*   **Response Obligations:** None yet, this is the opening.\n*   **Impact Analysis & Weighing:** The speech does a fair job of outlining why the arguments matter. It brings up both practical and philosophical points. Impact could be stronger though - needs more concrete real-world harms of NOT doing what we recommend and more benefits of doing what we recommend.\n\nOverall, the speech presents a reasonably strong affirmative case, but it's a bit lacking in the anticipatory clash and real-world impact.
