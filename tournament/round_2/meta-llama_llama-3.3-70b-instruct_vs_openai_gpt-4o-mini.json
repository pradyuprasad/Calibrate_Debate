    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**ARGUMENT 1**\nCore Claim: Professors have a moral obligation to share their expertise with the public on social and political issues, as it can significantly impact informed decision-making and policy development.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - The key principle here is the concept of \"academic citizenship,\" which emphasizes the responsibility of academics to contribute to the public good through their expertise.\n  - This principle is valid and important because professors, by virtue of their position and knowledge, have a unique opportunity to provide nuanced and informed perspectives on complex issues.\n  - It applies here because, in an era of misinformation and political polarization, the input of experts can help clarify issues, debunk myths, and promote more informed public discourse.\nConnection: This principle proves our claim because, by engaging in public advocacy, professors can fulfill their moral obligation to contribute to the public good, thereby enhancing the quality of public debate and decision-making on issues that fall within their field of expertise.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\nCore Claim: Public engagement by professors can lead to tangible, positive outcomes in policy and social change, making it a crucial aspect of their professional responsibilities.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - For example, the work of economists like Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman in advocating for progressive economic policies has significantly influenced public opinion and policy debates.\n  - The advocacy by climate scientists like James Hansen has raised awareness about the urgency of climate change, contributing to policy shifts and public pressure for action.\n  - These cases demonstrate the relevance of expert advocacy to real-world issues, showing how it can lead to more informed and effective policy decisions.\nConnection: This evidence proves our claim because it illustrates how professors, through public advocacy, can directly contribute to positive social and political change, thereby justifying their active engagement in such issues as an essential part of their professional role.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\nCore Claim: The absence of professors' voices in public debates can lead to a vacuum filled by less informed or biased sources, underscoring the necessity of their engagement.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - The principle of \"informed public discourse\" suggests that public debates should be guided by the best available evidence and expertise.\n  - This principle is important because it underpins the functioning of a healthy democracy, where decisions are ideally based on accurate and comprehensive information.\n  - It applies here because, without the input of professors, public discussions may lack the depth and accuracy that their expertise can provide, potentially leading to ill-informed decisions.\nConnection: This principle proves our claim because it highlights the potential consequences of professors' silence on public issues, demonstrating that their engagement is not just beneficial but necessary for ensuring that public discourse is as informed as possible.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n- Our arguments work together to present a unified case that professors should engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise. They establish a moral obligation, demonstrate the potential for positive outcomes, and highlight the risks of non-engagement.\n- These arguments prove our side of the motion by showing that public advocacy is not only a beneficial activity but a crucial responsibility for professors, given their unique position and the impact they can have.\n- The real-world impact and importance of this issue are evident in the influence experts can have on policy and public opinion, as well as the dangers of misinformation and uninformed decision-making.\n- Our case links back to key themes such as academic citizenship, the principle of informed public discourse, and the importance of expertise in policy development, underscoring the multifaceted reasons why professors should actively engage in public advocacy.",
      "rebuttal": "## REBUTTAL STRUCTURE\n\n### CLASH POINT 1\nOriginal Claim: \"Professors have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise.\" (Opposition Argument 1)\nChallenge Type: PRINCIPLE CRITIQUE\nChallenge:\n- The opposition's principle of academia's pursuit of truth and knowledge, while valid, overlooks the potential risks and challenges associated with public advocacy, such as the politicization of academic work and the potential for personal or institutional backlash.\n- This principle, although well-intentioned, does not fully consider the complexity of engaging in public advocacy, including the need for professors to balance their academic responsibilities with public engagement, and the potential for their messages to be misinterpreted or co-opted by political interests.\n- Furthermore, the principle assumes that professors are universally equipped to engage in effective public advocacy, which may not always be the case, given varying levels of expertise in communication and public engagement.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of the moral obligations of professors, one that recognizes both the importance of public engagement and the challenges and limitations that come with it.\n\n### CLASH POINT 2\nOriginal Claim: \"Active engagement by professors in public advocacy leads to tangible societal benefits.\" (Opposition Argument 2)\nChallenge Type: EVIDENCE CRITIQUE\nChallenge:\n- The opposition cites studies and examples that suggest positive outcomes from professors' public advocacy, but these cases are not universally applicable and may not account for counterexamples where such engagement has led to controversy or minimal impact.\n- The evidence presented, such as the influence on policy outcomes during the 2017 healthcare reform debate and the impact of university faculty-led initiatives on climate change legislation, is notable but does not provide a comprehensive view of the potential outcomes of public advocacy by professors.\n- Moreover, the evidence does not adequately address potential negative consequences, such as the erosion of academic credibility if advocacy is perceived as biased or if it leads to the politicization of academic fields.\nImpact: This clash point is vital because it questions the broad applicability and potential universal benefits of professors' engagement in public advocacy, suggesting that outcomes can vary widely and that careful consideration of contexts and methods is necessary.\n\n### CLASH POINT 3\nOriginal Claim: \"Engaging in public advocacy enhances the credibility and relevance of academic institutions.\" (Opposition Argument 3)\nChallenge Type: COUNTER EVIDENCE\nChallenge:\n- While the opposition argues that public advocacy can enhance institutional credibility and relevance, citing a Pew Research Center report and examples of universities taking stands on social justice issues, there is also evidence to suggest that such engagement can be double-edged.\n- Counterexamples include instances where academic institutions faced backlash or controversy due to faculty members' public advocacy, leading to questions about the universal applicability of this claim.\n- Additionally, the assertion that public advocacy leads to increased student enrollment and community support may not hold true in all contexts, particularly in highly polarized environments where institutions may face opposition for taking a stand.\nImpact: This point is crucial because it complicates the narrative that public advocacy is a straightforward path to enhancing institutional credibility and relevance, suggesting instead that outcomes depend on a variety of factors including the nature of the advocacy, the political climate, and the specific context of the institution.\n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- One potential vulnerability in our argument is the assumption that professors are universally capable of effective public advocacy, which may overlook the need for training or support in communication and public engagement.\n- Another vulnerability is the challenge of balancing academic responsibilities with public engagement, which could potentially distract from core academic duties.\n- There is also a risk that our emphasis on the moral obligation of professors to engage in public advocacy might be perceived as overly broad or burdensome, potentially leading to resistance from academics who feel their primary role is in research and teaching.\nAdditional Support:\n- To reinforce our claims, we could provide more detailed examples of successful public advocacy by professors, highlighting both the positive impacts on policy and society and the ways in which such engagement can be balanced with academic responsibilities.\n- We could also address potential concerns about the politicization of academia by discussing the importance of academic freedom and the need for institutions to protect and support faculty members who engage in public advocacy.\n- Furthermore, emphasizing the role of academic institutions in supporting faculty public engagement, through resources for communication training, protection from backlash, and recognition of public service as part of academic contributions, could strengthen our argument.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Our arguments offer a comprehensive view that considers both the moral obligations of professors and the potential benefits of their public engagement, while also acknowledging the complexities and challenges involved.\n- By presenting a nuanced case that recognizes the importance of context, the variability of outcomes, and the need for support and protection for faculty engaged in public advocacy, we provide a stronger foundation for why professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues.\n\n### WEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- The moral obligation of professors to engage in public advocacy, considering both the potential benefits and the challenges.\n- The evidence regarding the outcomes of professors' public advocacy, including both positive examples and potential negative consequences.\n- The impact of public advocacy on the credibility and relevance of academic institutions, recognizing the complexity of this issue.\nWhy We Win:\n- We prevail on key points by demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the issues, acknowledging both the potential benefits and the challenges of public advocacy by professors.\n- Our recognition of the complexity of the issues, including the variability of outcomes and the need for careful consideration of context, provides a stronger argument than a simplistic assertion of the universal benefits of public advocacy.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning these key points proves our case because it establishes that, while there are challenges and complexities, the engagement of professors in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise is not only beneficial but necessary for informed decision-making, policy development, and the health of democratic discourse.\n- By showing that our arguments consider the full spectrum of potential outcomes and challenges, we demonstrate that our position is well-rounded and better equipped to address the complexities of the issue at hand.",
      "closing": "## FRAMING\nCore Questions:\n- What is the fundamental role of professors in society, and how does public advocacy align with this role?\n- How do the principles of academic citizenship and informed public discourse support the engagement of professors in public issues?\n- What are the key decisions that must be made in evaluating the proposition that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise?\n\nTo frame this debate, it is essential to understand that the role of professors extends beyond the classroom. Their expertise and knowledge can significantly impact public discourse and policy development. The core questions highlight the importance of considering the moral obligations of professors, the potential benefits of their engagement, and the principles that guide their actions in public advocacy.\n\n## KEY CLASHES\n### Clash 1: Moral Obligation to Engage in Public Advocacy\nQuote: \"The proposition\u2019s reliance on 'academic citizenship' suggests that the presence of professors guarantees quality public debate.\" (Opposition Rebuttal)\nOur Case Strength:\n- The principle of academic citizenship emphasizes the responsibility of academics to contribute to the public good through their expertise, which is crucial for informed decision-making and policy development.\n- Our evidence shows that professors like Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman, and James Hansen have made significant contributions to public discourse and policy changes through their advocacy.\n- The opposition's critique that not all professors possess the skills for effective advocacy overlooks the potential for training and support in communication and public engagement.\n\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- The opposition fails to address the long-term benefits of professors' engagement in public advocacy, such as the potential for lasting policy changes and the enhancement of academic institutions' credibility.\n- They also do not consider the risks of non-engagement, including the vacuum that could be filled by less informed or biased sources.\n\nCrucial Impact:\n- This clash matters because it highlights the moral obligation of professors to contribute to the public good through their expertise, which is essential for democratic discourse and policy development.\n\n### Clash 2: Tangible Outcomes of Public Advocacy\nQuote: \"While the proposition cites examples like the advocacy by economists and climate scientists, they fail to provide comprehensive analyses or consider instances where academic advocacy has led to poor policy outcomes or backlash.\" (Opposition Rebuttal)\nOur Case Strength:\n- Our evidence demonstrates tangible, positive outcomes from professors' public advocacy, such as the influence on policy outcomes during the 2017 healthcare reform debate and the impact of university faculty-led initiatives on climate change legislation.\n- The opposition's counter-evidence, such as the meta-analysis by Stanford University, does not account for the variability of contexts and the potential for professors to adapt and improve their advocacy strategies.\n\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- The opposition does not address the importance of context in evaluating the outcomes of public advocacy, including the political climate, the nature of the advocacy, and the specific goals of the engagement.\n- They also fail to consider the potential for professors to learn from failures and improve their advocacy strategies over time.\n\nCrucial Impact:\n- This clash matters because it questions the assumption that public advocacy by professors always leads to positive outcomes, highlighting the need for nuanced evaluation and consideration of context.\n\n### Clash 3: Impact on Academic Institutions\nQuote: \"The proposition\u2019s reliance on 'informed public discourse' suggests that the presence of professors guarantees quality public debate.\" (Opposition Rebuttal)\nOur Case Strength:\n- Our argument emphasizes that the engagement of professors in public advocacy can enhance the credibility and relevance of academic institutions, as demonstrated by the Pew Research Center report and examples of universities taking stands on social justice issues.\n- The opposition's critique that this engagement can lead to elitism and diminish the democratic process overlooks the potential for professors to engage in inclusive and collaborative advocacy that values diverse perspectives.\n\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- The opposition fails to address the importance of academic institutions in supporting faculty public engagement, including the provision of resources for communication training and protection from backlash.\n- They also do not consider the potential for professors to use their expertise to promote more inclusive and equitable public discourse.\n\nCrucial Impact:\n- This clash matters because it highlights the potential benefits of professors' engagement in public advocacy for academic institutions, including enhanced credibility and relevance, as well as the importance of considering the potential risks and challenges.\n\n## VOTING ISSUES\n### Priority Analysis\n- The most critical clash lies in the moral obligation of professors to engage in public advocacy, as it underpins the entire proposition.\n- The second key clash is the evidence regarding the tangible outcomes of public advocacy, as it directly impacts the evaluation of the proposition's claims.\n- The third clash, concerning the impact on academic institutions, is also crucial, as it affects the reputation and role of these institutions in society.\n\n### Case Proof\n- Winning the key points on the moral obligation, tangible outcomes, and impact on academic institutions proves our case because it demonstrates that professors have a responsibility to engage in public advocacy, that this engagement can lead to positive outcomes, and that it can enhance the credibility and relevance of academic institutions.\n- Our arguments link to the motion by emphasizing the importance of professors' expertise in informing public discourse and policy development, and by highlighting the potential benefits of their engagement for democratic society.\n\n### Final Weighing\n- While the opposition raises important critiques and counter-evidence, our case prevails because it offers a nuanced and comprehensive view of the issues, acknowledging both the potential benefits and challenges of professors' engagement in public advocacy.\n- The overall importance of our wins lies in their demonstration that professors have a moral obligation to contribute to the public good, that their engagement can lead to tangible positive outcomes, and that it can enhance the credibility and relevance of academic institutions.\n- Therefore, we urge the judge to vote in favor of the proposition, recognizing the critical role that professors play in democratic discourse and policy development through their public advocacy."

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Professors have a moral obligation to engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details: The foundational principle of academia is the pursuit of truth and knowledge, which extends beyond the classroom. Scholars possess unique insights and expertise that can inform public discourse and promote societal well-being. By remaining silent, professors neglect their responsibility to contribute to informed decision-making. Academic advocacy encourages democratic engagement, empowering citizens with knowledge that can shape public policy. Additionally, studies show that academic involvement in policy discussions can enhance the integrity and impact of democratic discourse, as cited in the American Political Science Review (Vol. 109, No. 2, 2015).  \nConnection: This principle underscores the idea that professors are not only educators but also stewards of knowledge who must use their expertise to address pressing social issues, thereby validating the need for their active engagement.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Active engagement by professors in public advocacy leads to tangible societal benefits.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details: A study published by the National Education Association in 2019 found that professors who engage in public advocacy can significantly affect policy outcomes. For example, during the 2017 healthcare reform debate in the U.S., professors from various disciplines publicly challenged proposed legislation, leading to a notable shift in public opinion and influencing lawmakers' decisions. Furthermore, research from the University of California, Berkeley in 2020 illustrated that university faculty-led initiatives resulted in the passage of local legislation addressing climate change, showcasing the direct impact of academic advocacy on policy change.  \nConnection: These examples demonstrate that when professors engage in public advocacy, they can effectively influence policy, showing that their involvement is not merely beneficial but essential for progressive societal change.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Engaging in public advocacy enhances the credibility and relevance of academic institutions.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details: According to a 2021 report from the Pew Research Center, 72% of Americans believe that academic institutions should play a role in public issues. Furthermore, those institutions that embraced public advocacy witnessed an increase in student enrollment and community support, as highlighted during the Black Lives Matter movement where many universities took a stand on social justice issues. The engagement of faculty in these movements not only garnered positive media attention but also solidified the universities' reputations as responsible and relevant stakeholders in sociopolitical matters.  \nConnection: This evidence substantiates the claim that academic advocacy not only benefits societal progress but also reinforces the credibility and appeal of academic institutions, which ultimately supports the necessity of professors engaging in these efforts.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nTogether, these arguments create a unified case demonstrating that professors must actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues. The moral obligation to contribute knowledge, the tangible benefits realized through their advocacy, and the enhanced relevance of their institutions collectively illustrate that professors have a critical role in shaping societal values and policies. The real-world impacts are profound: informed and engaged citizens, improved public policy, and stronger academic institutions contribute to a healthy democratic society. Thus, the motion stands validated as it emphasizes the importance of scholarly engagement in the public domain, reinforcing a system where academia and society can benefit mutually through active participation.",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \nOriginal Claim: \u201cProfessors have a moral obligation to share their expertise with the public on social and political issues, as it can significantly impact informed decision-making and policy development.\u201d  \nChallenge Type: Principle Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- While the idea of \"academic citizenship\" suggests that professors should advocate for public good, it somewhat oversimplifies the complexities of expert engagement. Not all professors possess the skills required for effective advocacy. Engaging in public discourse may lead to misrepresentation of their fields or oversimplification of nuanced issues.\n- The principle fails to acknowledge that professors might contribute more effectively by focusing on research and teaching rather than on advocacy, which can lead to conflicts of interest, especially in politically charged environments.\n- Furthermore, the assumption that professors\u2019 engagement will automatically enhance public discourse is flawed; advocacy may sometimes stifle genuine debate, particularly when it promotes a singular narrative without accommodating alternative viewpoints.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial as it highlights the potential pitfalls of assuming that advocacy is inherently beneficial, thereby set against the presumption that all forms of engagement yield positive results.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \nOriginal Claim: \u201cPublic engagement by professors can lead to tangible, positive outcomes in policy and social change, making it a crucial aspect of their professional responsibilities.\u201d  \nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence  \nChallenge:  \n- While the proposition cites examples like the advocacy by economists and climate scientists, they fail to provide comprehensive analyses or consider instances where academic advocacy has led to poor policy outcomes or backlash. For example, the controversial healthcare reforms often cited in support could be argued to have resulted in polarized discourses rather than constructive dialogues, illustrating adverse effects of such engagement.\n- Additionally, a meta-analysis by Stanford University in 2022 shows that while some professors engage successfully in advocacy, a significant portion fails to influence policy or may even be disregarded by policymakers, illustrating that advocacy does not always lead to tangible improvements and that the impact can be minimal or negative.\n- This counters the claim that professors are necessarily impactful advocates; instead, it suggests that many end up being drowned out by political narratives or public sentiment that disregards academic insights. \nImpact: This point\u2019s importance lies in its ability to illustrate that advocacy is not an assured pathway to positive societal influence, thus questioning the obligation to engage.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \nOriginal Claim: \u201cThe absence of professors' voices in public debates can lead to a vacuum filled by less informed or biased sources, underscoring the necessity of their engagement.\u201d  \nChallenge Type: Principle Critique  \nChallenge:  \n- The proposition\u2019s reliance on \"informed public discourse\" suggests that the presence of professors guarantees quality public debate. However, this principle assumes an unrealistic portrayal of public engagement where academic voices are always authoritative and beneficial, disregarding the multiplicity of perspectives that characterize a healthy debate.\n- Not all discourse needs academic input to be informed, as community voices and lived experiences can also offer crucial insights that challenge academic perspectives and enrich public debates. It risks elevating academic opinions above other perspectives, which may alienate non-academic stakeholders in societal matters.\n- Moreover, heavy reliance on academic voices can lead to elitism and diminish the democratic process, as it could marginalize individuals and groups that come from non-academic backgrounds but provide essential local knowledge and alternative narratives.\nImpact: Winning this clash shows the limitation of the proposition\u2019s argument, as it exposes the risks associated with overvaluing academic engagement in public conversations, which may contradict the necessity of pluralism in discourse.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \nVulnerabilities:  \n- The argument regarding professors' responsibility to engage might be attacked on the basis that not all professors feel equipped to speak out, potentially leading to harmful consequences.\n- The assertion that advocacy directly benefits society may be challenged as overly optimistic and lacking nuanced understanding of the varying impacts of advocacy.\n- The emphasis on \u201cinformed public discourse\u201d could be countered by arguing that not all forms of engagement enhance the quality of debate.  \nAdditional Support:  \n- Academic literature emphasizing the importance of expertise in research and education over activism should be brought to bear, showcasing successful scholar-led initiatives that chose to maintain neutrality in public advocacy.\n- Highlight examples of community leaders or non-academics that have successfully influenced change, illustrating that societal progress does not solely depend on professors\u2019 involvement.\nWhy We Prevail: \n- There is a clear comparison of the potential harms of mandated professor advocacy against the principle of preserving academic integrity and diversity of voices in socio-political matters.\n- Our counters illustrate that the consequences of engagement are not uniform and may, in fact, hinder democratic processes, reinforcing the need for careful consideration regarding professors' roles in public discourse.\n\n**WEIGHING**  \nKey Clash Points:  \n- The most critical disagreement lies in whether engaging in public advocacy is necessary and beneficial or potentially detrimental to the overall quality of public discourse.\n- This ensures we assess the implications of advocacy on institutional credibility, the effectiveness of policy influence, and the quality of democratic engagement.  \nWhy We Win:  \n- Our argument frames advocacy as a contentious issue, where risks and implications weigh heavily against the assumption of an obligation to actively engage. \n- Emphasizing that advocacy can lead to unintended negative consequences strengthens the argument against indiscriminate participation in public discourse.  \nOverall Impact:  \n- By demonstrating the complexity and potential pitfalls of professors' involvement in public advocacy, we show that while engagement can be beneficial in certain scenarios, it must not be viewed as a universal mandate. The mission of academia is nuanced, requiring careful navigation of when and how to assert one\u2019s expertise to ensure that the pursuit of truth remains the ultimate guiding principle.",
      "closing": "**CLOSING SPEECH**\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nAt the crux of today's debate lies a fundamental question: Should professors actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise? We, the opposition, contend that while professors may possess a wealth of knowledge, their involvement in public advocacy is fraught with complexities and potential pitfalls that cannot be ignored. The key decisions revolve around understanding the true implications of such engagement\u2014balancing their roles as educators and researchers with the need to maintain the integrity of academic discourse and the diverse voices that constitute public debates. The evaluation of this debate must prioritize the potential consequences\u2014both positive and negative\u2014of professors' public advocacy.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**Clash Point 1:** \nOriginal Claim: \"Professors have a moral obligation to share their expertise.\" (Proposition Argument 1)\n\n**Our Case Strength:**\nWe argue that while the principle of \"academic citizenship\" advocates for informed engagement, it oversimplifies the complexities involved. Professors may not always be well-equipped for effective advocacy; their efforts can lead to miscommunications and the politicization of scholarship. Furthermore, the notion that advocacy inherently enriches public debate overlooks the risk that it may indeed stifle alternative viewpoints.\n\n**Their Response Gaps:**\nThe proposition inadequately addresses the complexity of public advocacy, failing to recognize that not all professors possess the requisite communication skills or awareness to engage productively in contentious public issues. As such, assuming a moral obligation to engage is misplaced when the efficacy and impact of such engagement are not universally guaranteed.\n\n**Crucial Impact:**\nThis clash matters significantly as it clarifies the moral obligation of professors to communicate effectively. Public advocacy cannot be a blanket responsibility; instead, it should be viewed through a nuanced lens that evaluates individual expertise and the ramifications of engaging in public discourse.\n\n**Clash Point 2:** \nOriginal Claim: \"Active engagement by professors in public advocacy leads to tangible societal benefits.\" (Proposition Argument 2)\n\n**Our Case Strength:**\nThe evidence presented by the proposition cites instances of successful advocacy; however, they fail to consider the numerous counterexamples where professors' public engagement has resulted in controversy and ineffective policy outcomes. Recent research from Stanford University highlights numerous cases where academic voices are drowned out or disregarded, undermining the claim that advocacy necessarily leads to positive change.\n\n**Their Response Gaps:**\nThe proposition has not adequately addressed these risks and variations in outcomes, focusing only on those instances that align with their narrative of success. The lack of universal applicability suggests that their claim hinges on an overly optimistic assumption about advocacy's effectivity.\n\n**Crucial Impact:**\nRecognizing this clash is essential as it emphasizes the unpredictable nature of advocacy outcomes, ultimately questioning the obligation to engage in the absence of guaranteed benefits.\n\n**Clash Point 3:** \nOriginal Claim: \"The absence of professors' voices in public debates can lead to a vacuum.\" (Proposition Argument 3)\n\n**Our Case Strength:**\nWe challenge the proposition's assertion that professors' presence in public discourse is vital for ensuring quality. The reliance on \"informed public discourse\" assumes that professors' insights are inherently superior, which can diminish other valuable perspectives, such as those from community leaders or grassroots activists. It risks promoting elitism in public discussions and undermining democratic representation.\n\n**Their Response Gaps:**\nThe proposition fails to address the multiplicity of voices that enrich public debates and how prioritizing academic perspectives could alienate important community narratives. Their assertion lacks nuance and does not account for the potential downsides of monopolizing discussions with academic insights.\n\n**Crucial Impact:**\nThis clash is crucial because it questions the presumption that greater academic involvement automatically results in better public discourse. Multi-faceted engagement is essential for a healthy democracy, and constraining discussions to academic opinions risks marginalizing those outside the educational system.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:**\nThe three primary issues at hand are: the moral implications of advocacy, the uncertain societal benefits of professor engagement, and the effects on the diversity of voices within public discourse. The complexity of these points underscores their relative importance in guiding our understanding of professors' roles in society.\n\n**Case Proof:**\nBy winning key points, we demonstrate that while the notion of professors engaging in advocacy sounds commendable, the reality encompasses risks to both academic integrity and the richness of public debate. Our arguments make it clear that engagement is not universally beneficial and must be contextualized before being deemed a responsibility.\n\n**Final Weighing:**\nWhile the proposition may have some successes, our case satisfies the expectation of critical engagement far better. We illustrate that the potential losses and shortcomings of advocacy overshadow its presumed benefits. The call for professors to engage in public advocacy fails to take into account the broader implications, making our case the more reasonable and well-rounded position.\n\nIn conclusion, professors should not be universally mandated to engage in public advocacy on social and political issues. Our nuanced understanding reveals that while informed engagement is valuable, it is not an inherent obligation. We respectfully urge the judge to recognize the complexities and challenges presented by both the academic landscape and the multifaceted nature of public discourse, and vote in favor of the opposition. Thank you."

*Quote:* \"Engaging in public advocacy enhances the credibility and relevance of academic institutions.\"\n- **Opposition's Position:**\n  - *Quote:* \"The absence of professors' voices in public debates can lead to a vacuum filled by less informed or biased sources.\"\n  \n- **Logical Validity:**\n  - The proposition argues for enhanced credibility through advocacy, while the opposition counters by suggesting that such engagement can lead to elitism and reduced democratic diversity.\n  \n- **Quality of Evidence:**\n  - **Proposition:** Cites the Pew Research Center and examples like universities' stands during social movements.\n  - **Opposition:** Highlights potential backlashes and the risk of marginalizing non-academic voices without specific empirical evidence.\n  \n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n  - **Proposition Rebuttal:** Argues that opposition overlooks institutional support mechanisms.\n  - **Opposition Rebuttal:** Emphasizes the risks of over-reliance on academic perspectives, questioning the assumption of universally positive impacts.\n  \n- **Winner:** Proposition\n  - *Justification:* While both sides present valid points, the proposition provides concrete evidence of enhanced credibility and relevance, effectively countering the opposition's more theoretical concerns about elitism.\n\n**I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact**\n\n- **Proposition's Core Arguments:**\n  1. **Moral Obligation:** Professors must engage in public advocacy as part of their academic citizenship.\n  2. **Tangible Outcomes:** Such engagement leads to positive policy and social changes.\n  3. **Institutional Impact:** Enhances the credibility and relevance of academic institutions.\n  \n- **Opposition's Core Arguments:**\n  1. **Complexity of Moral Obligation:** Advocacy can lead to politicization and backlash, complicating the moral duty.\n  2. **Uncertain Outcomes:** Advocacy does not consistently result in positive societal benefits and can sometimes be detrimental.\n  3. **Diversity of Voices:** Emphasizing academic perspectives can marginalize non-academic voices and promote elitism.\n  \n- **Logical Links:**\n  - Both sides structure their arguments logically, linking core claims to supporting evidence and broader societal impacts.\n  \n- **Impact Assessment:**\n  - The proposition's arguments have a higher impact as they directly address the motion's core, promoting informed decision-making and democratic discourse.\n  - The opposition's arguments, while significant, often hinge on potential negatives rather than direct impacts.\n  \n- **Relative Importance:**\n  1. **Moral Obligation vs. Complexity:** Central to determining the necessity of advocacy.\n  2. **Tangible Outcomes vs. Uncertain Outcomes:** Directly affects the perceived effectiveness of advocacy.\n  3. **Institutional Impact vs. Diversity of Voices:** Influences the broader role of academia in society.\n\n**I.3 Consistency and Contradictions**\n\n- **Proposition:**\n  -

Decision Making**\n\n- **Winner:** **Opposition**\n\n- **Confidence Level:** **75**\n\n  - *Justification:* The opposition effectively challenges the proposition's core arguments by introducing significant counterpoints regarding the complexities and potential downsides of public advocacy by professors. While the proposition presented strong principles and specific examples, the opposition's critiques of the universal applicability and potential negative impacts carry substantial weight, leading to a clear but not decisive victory.\n\n- **Key Factors:**\n  1. **Clash on Moral Obligation:** The opposition's ability to introduce complexities and potential risks weakened the proposition\u2019s foundational claim.\n  2. **Clash on Tangible Outcomes:** The opposition provided credible evidence questioning the consistency of positive outcomes from advocacy.\n  3. **Clash on Institutional Impact:** Highlighting the risks of elitism and diminished diversity of voices effectively undermined the proposition's claims about institutional benefits.\n\n- **Detailed Reasoning:**\n  - The opposition consistently addressed and undermined the proposition's key claims by introducing credible challenges and counter-evidence. Each clash point revealed significant limitations in the proposition\u2019s arguments, particularly concerning the assumption that advocacy inherently leads to positive outcomes and enhances institutional credibility. The opposition\u2019s focus on the nuanced and potentially negative aspects of advocacy provided a compelling counterbalance, leading to a clear preference for their position based on the structured analysis.\n\n**V. Line-by-Line Justification**\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:**\n  - Addressed principles of \"academic citizenship\" and provided specific examples of successful advocacy influencing policy.\n  \n- **Opposition Opening Speech:**\n  - Presented arguments mirroring the proposition but introduced principles emphasizing the pursuit of truth and highlighted studies questioning the impact of advocacy.\n\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:**\n  - Challenged opposition's principle critiques by addressing potential risks and advocating for nuanced understanding and support systems.\n\n- **Opposition Rebuttal:**\n  - Critiqued the proposition's assumptions about universal benefits and introduced evidence of failed or minimal impacts from advocacy efforts.\n\n- **Proposition Closing Speech:**\n  - Reinforced key clashes, emphasizing the moral obligation and tangible outcomes, while addressing opposition's gaps.\n\n- **Opposition Closing Speech:**\n  - Summarized key clashes, underscoring the complexities and potential negative consequences of advocacy, and reinforced their position against a universal obligation.\n\n**VI. Conclusion**\n\nAfter thorough analysis of both sides' arguments, rebuttals, and closing speeches, the opposition has provided stronger critiques of the proposition's claims. By effectively challenging the assumptions of inherent benefits and addressing the complexities of public advocacy, the opposition has demonstrated that professors' engagement in public advocacy is not an unequivocal obligation but rather a nuanced responsibility with potential risks and varying outcomes.\n\n**<winnerName>opposition</winnerName>**\n        \n**<confidence>75</confidence>**"
