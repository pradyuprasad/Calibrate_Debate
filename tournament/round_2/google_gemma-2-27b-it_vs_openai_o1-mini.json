    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "closing": "\n\n\n## Closing Speech: Proposition\n\nThe Opposition has presented a compelling case for the continued dominance of governments in space exploration. They paint a picture of vital national security imperatives, groundbreaking scientific advancement, and the unique challenges of the space industry that necessitate direct government control.\n\nHowever, their arguments rely on a nostalgic view of government capability and a misguided fear of the dynamism and innovation that the private sector brings to the table. While we acknowledge past achievements and the importance of national security, clinging to outdated models will only hinder humanity\u2019s progress in reaching the stars.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the core flaws in their defense:\n\n\n### CLASH POINT 1: Efficiency & Innovation\n\n **Their Claim:** Government-led programs are more efficient and drive innovation.\n\n **Our Counter:** While the Opposition cites the Apollo program's achievements, they conveniently forget its astronomical costs and schedule overruns. Furthermore, they fail to acknowledge the critical role SpaceX has played in revolutionizing space travel through innovative reusable rockets, developments that would have been stifled by the bureaucratic hurdles and slow-moving pace of solely government-run programs.\n\n**Our Point:**\n\nThe private sector\u2019s agility, driven by competition and profit motives, fosters rapid innovation and cost reduction at a pace unimaginable under government control. SpaceX quickly iterates designs, adapts to market demands, and pushes technological boundaries \u2013 a stark contrast to the often lethargic nature of government projects.\n\n### CLASH POINT 2: Regulation vs. the \"Free Market\"\n\n**Their Claim:** The \"free market\" principle doesn't apply to space exploration due to high barriers to entry and long development timelines.\n\n**Our Counter:**\n\nThis argument reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the evolving space industry. While entry barriers exist, they are being chipped away by private initiatives like SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, which is democratizing access to space through constellations of smaller, more affordable satellites.\n\n**Our Point:**\n\nThe Opposition\u2019s reliance on government-led missions to ensure innovation ignores the potential unleashed by fostering a competitive marketplace.  By creating a clear regulatory framework, we can encourage a diverse ecosystem of businesses to develop specialized technologies, overcome existing barriers, and push the boundaries of space exploration in ways never before imagined.\n\n### CLASH POINT 3: Benefits for Humanity\n\n**Their Claim:** A collaborative government-private model is essential for maximizing benefits for humanity.\n\n**Our Counter:**\n\nThis sounds good in theory, but their framework\n\neffectively hands control of the future of space to bureaucrats and risk-averse government agencies.\n\n**Our Point:**\n\nCompetition within the private sector will drive down costs, making space exploration more accessible to everyone. This will lead to a proliferation of new technologies and applications with tangible benefits for society, from improved communications and Earth observation to novel materials and energy sources.\n\n### FINAL WEIGHING\n\nWhile the Opposition eloquently defends the status quo, their arguments are rooted in the past. We must embrace the future, a future where the dynamism and ingenuity of the private sector drive humanity's expansion into the cosmos. By transitioning to a regulatory and oversight role, we unleash the full potential of space exploration, accelerating innovation, reducing costs, and ultimately benefiting all of humanity.\n\nLet\u2019s not be bound by outdated models and a fear of the unknown. Let\u2019s empower the innovators, the dreamers, and the risk-takers to lead us to a new era of space exploration \u2013 a future where the stars are within everyone\u2019s reach. \n\n\n\n**Vote Proposition - for a bold, innovative, and ultimately more beneficial future in space.**"

      "opening": "**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Government direct involvement in space operations is essential for ensuring national security and strategic autonomy.\n\n**Support Type:** Principle\n\n**Support Details:**  \n- **Key Principle:** National security relies on a nation's ability to control and protect its space assets, including satellites used for communication, navigation, and reconnaissance.\n- **Validity/Importance:** Space has become a critical domain for defense and intelligence operations. Direct government control ensures that strategic assets are safeguarded against threats such as cyber-attacks, anti-satellite weapons, and other forms of space-based aggression.\n- **Application:** Governments managing their own space operations can rapidly respond to security threats, maintain command and control over critical infrastructure, and develop defense-oriented space technologies without reliance on private entities.\n\n**Connection:** Direct government operation of space activities ensures that national security interests are prioritized and protected. Private sector oversight alone cannot provide the necessary level of security and strategic control required to defend against sophisticated threats in the increasingly contested space environment.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Government-operated space programs are fundamental drivers of technological innovation and sustained leadership in space exploration.\n\n**Support Type:** Evidence\n\n**Support Details:**  \n- **Specific Examples:** NASA's Apollo program in the 1960s led to significant technological advancements, including developments in computing, materials science, and telecommunications. More recently, the creation of the International Space Station (ISS) has fostered innovations in life support systems and international collaboration technologies.\n- **Real World Cases and Outcomes:** SpaceX, while a private company, has relied heavily on government contracts and support to develop reusable rocket technology, which has revolutionized the cost and efficiency of space travel. Without direct government investment and operational leadership, such breakthroughs may not have been possible.\n- **Clear Relevance:** Government-funded research institutions and space agencies have historically been at the forefront of pushing the boundaries of what is possible in space, setting the stage for private sector advancements to build upon.\n\n**Connection:** The direct operation of space programs by governments not only leads to groundbreaking technological innovations but also establishes a foundation upon which the private sector can expand. Regulation and oversight alone cannot replicate the comprehensive research, development, and risk-taking that government-led missions facilitate, thereby ensuring sustained leadership in space exploration.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe arguments presented form a cohesive and compelling case against transitioning the government's primary role in space to mere regulation and oversight. Firstly, maintaining direct government involvement is crucial for national security and strategic autonomy, ensuring that a nation\u2019s space assets are protected against evolving threats. Secondly, government-operated space programs are pivotal in driving technological innovation and sustaining leadership in space exploration, laying the groundwork for private sector advancements. Together, these arguments demonstrate that direct government operation not only safeguards critical interests but also fosters an environment where technological breakthroughs can thrive. The real-world impact of diminishing government operational roles could lead to vulnerabilities in national security and a slowdown in innovation, ultimately hindering a nation's ability to compete and collaborate effectively in the global space arena. Thus, preserving and strengthening government involvement in space operations is imperative for both security and progress, underscoring the necessity of opposing the motion.",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH: OPPOSITION SIDE**\n\n---\n\n### CLASH POINT 1\n**Original Claim:** \"Direct government operation of space activities is inefficient and prone to bureaucratic inertia, hindering innovation and progress.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence\n\n**Challenge:**\n- **Presentation of Stronger Opposing Evidence:** While the Proposition cites the Space Shuttle program's cost overruns and delays as evidence of inefficiency, it overlooks the substantial achievements and long-term benefits derived from such programs. For instance, the Space Shuttle program enabled the construction of the International Space Station (ISS), fostering international collaboration and scientific advancements that private companies alone might not have achieved.\n- **Relevance and Compelling Nature of Opposition's Evidence:** Government-operated programs often undertake missions with high risks and long-term scientific goals that are not immediately profitable, ensuring comprehensive exploration and research. Additionally, recent government initiatives like NASA's Artemis program demonstrate enhanced efficiency through partnerships with private firms, combining government oversight with private sector agility.\n- **Direct Comparison of Competing Evidence:** While SpaceX has indeed reduced launch costs and accelerated development cycles, much of its success is built upon foundational technologies and infrastructure developed through decades of government investment and research. Without government-led initiatives, the private sector lacks the necessary support and foundational knowledge to achieve such breakthroughs independently.\n\n**Impact:**\nWinning this point is crucial as it undermines the Proposition's argument that government operations are inherently inefficient.
