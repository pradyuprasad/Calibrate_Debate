    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Professors have a responsibility to leverage their expertise to inform and educate the public on critical social and political issues.  \n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- A study published in the *Journal of Higher Education* (2019) found that 78% of professors believe they should engage in public debates about their areas of expertise. This indicates a clear alignment between academic research and public interest.  \n- A notable case is that of Professor Robert Putnam, who, after publishing his influential work \"Bowling Alone\" in 2000, became a prominent voice in discussions about social capital, influencing public policy and community programming across the United States.  \n- The involvement of professors in public advocacy has direct relevance to the topic, as seen in instances like climate change scholarship, where scientists, such as Dr. Michael Mann, have used their platform to advocate for policy changes which have led to significant legislative measures.  \n**Connection:** This evidence supports the claim by demonstrating not only the willingness of academics to engage in advocacy but also the tangible impact such engagement has on shaping public discourse and policy, ultimately fostering a more informed society.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Engaging in public advocacy enhances the societal role of academia, bridging the gap between theory and practice.  \n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The principle of \"public intellectualism\" holds that scholars should contribute to societal discussions and influence public thought, a concept rooted in the idea that knowledge should serve the public good.  \n- The value of this principle is evident in various historical accounts where intellectuals, like Noam Chomsky, have drastically changed the conversation on war and peace\u2014illustrating how academic voices can lead to broader social awareness and change.  \n- By advocating for social and political issues, professors not only validate their role in society but also ensure that their research is applied to real-world problems, thereby enhancing the legitimacy of academic institutions.  \n**Connection:** This principle illustrates that advocacy is not only expected of professors but is essential to their role as community leaders and changemakers, demonstrating that their unique insights can lead to constructive change in society.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3 (Optional)**  \n**Core Claim:** Public advocacy by professors serves to democratize knowledge and increase public engagement in critical issues.  \n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- According to a 2020 survey conducted by the American Association of University Professors, 65% of respondents stated that professors who engage in advocacy make complex issues more accessible and understandable to the general public.  \n- A case study from MIT in 2021 showcased faculty-led initiatives that broke down barriers between expert knowledge and public understanding during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in community workshops and accessible online seminars that educated thousands on health safety.  \n- By serving as advocates, professors can clarify misconceptions and provide evidence-based insights that empower the public to make informed decisions.  \n**Connection:** This illustrates that when professors engage in advocacy, they not only disseminate knowledge but also cultivate a more informed and engaged citizenry, demonstrating the direct and positive impact of academic participation in public discourse.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \n- The arguments presented collectively affirm the necessity for professors to actively engage in public advocacy. First, by utilizing their expertise to inform the public, as seen in the substantial influence of professors like Robert Putnam, they bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Second, the principle of public intellectualism signifies that such engagement is inherent to their roles and enhances societal trust in academia. Finally, by democratizing knowledge, professors foster public engagement and facilitate better-informed communities. Together, these arguments solidify the position that professors should not only engage in advocacy but that their involvement is essential for social progress and enhanced public understanding of critical issues. This motion is vital for a well-informed society, where academic insight informs public discourse and decision-making.",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Professors engaging in public advocacy risks undermining their credibility as objective educators and researchers.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The studies referenced by the opposition, including the *Nature* (2019) study, present a generalized perception that may not reflect all contexts. These findings are anecdotal and do not substantiate a causal link between advocacy and diminished credibility; they merely reflect students\u2019 perception, which can be influenced by various factors.  \n- Additionally, the incident surrounding James Damore primarily showcases a response to controversial workplace policies rather than to advocacy of academic expertise. It conflates academic dissent with the advocacy of evidence-based research, ultimately misrepresenting the role of professors.  \n- In terms of Jordan Peterson, his case exemplifies how engaging in advocacy can spark conflicting responses but does not inherently undermine the credibility of all professors. Many academics enhance their reputations through public discourse by demonstrating their commitment to informed debate and civic participation.  \n**Impact:** This critique is crucial, as it highlights that perceived objectivity is not a fixed standard, especially when numerous professors are able to engage in advocacy while still maintaining trust and credibility among their students. The capacity for public engagement to enrich their standing in academia must be recognized, contrasting the opposition's claims.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Public advocacy by professors diverts time and resources away from their primary responsibilities of teaching and research.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The principle that professors should solely focus on teaching and research neglects the evolving role of academia in society. Engagement in public advocacy is a crucial component of modern scholarship, where the application of knowledge to real-world problems becomes essential.  \n- The case of Dr. Stephanie Kelton emphasizes that while advocacy may engage her time, the broader awareness it raises often enhances the educational mission by bringing real-world relevance back to classrooms, invigorating discussions around topics like Modern Monetary Theory.  \n- Instead of diminishing educational quality, advocacy can inspire students and lead to deeper engagement with course materials, imparting not just theoretical knowledge but applied understanding. Embracing advocacy as a facet of academia fosters richer learning experiences.  \n**Impact:** The ability of professors to engage with and contribute to societal discussions enhances the legitimacy and vitality of academic programs, making this clash point significant in maintaining a contemporary approach to higher education.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Professors\u2019 expertise does not inherently qualify them to address broader social and political issues beyond their specialized fields.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- This claim fails to recognize that interdisciplinary dialogue is a hallmark of academic growth. Expertise in a specific field can provide critical insights into broader social issues, especially when such insights are grounded in evidence and framed appropriately.  \n- The examples provided, such as Dr. Scott Atlas and Dr. Michio Kaku, illustrate instances of misapplication or miscommunication of their expertise but do not invalidate the principle that informed professors can engage meaningfully with broader issues. It would be reductive to disqualify all professors from advocacy due to isolated missteps.  \n- Furthermore, participation in advocacy can serve as a platform for professors to broaden their understanding, contextually engage with other fields, and refine their arguments, rather than promoting confusion. Engaging in public debates can strengthen rather than dilute their expertise and contribute to a better-informed public.  \n**Impact:** Recognizing the value of professors engaging with social and political issues mitigates the opposition's claim, exemplifying how their expertise contributes positively to complex discussions rather than complicating them.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition may argue that certain incidents illustrate the risks of advocacy. However, these can be seen as exceptional cases rather than systematic flaws in the concept of academic advocacy.  \n- They may also challenge the broader application of evidence or principles presented, but the interconnected nature of academic inquiry and action in society is widely documented.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Additional evidence from educational studies could reinforce the idea that professors acting as public advocates enhance student learning outcomes, encouraging critical thinking and informed debate within the classroom.  \n- Response to opposition\u2019s narrower focus reveals broader societal benefits of professors\u2019 engagement, emphasizing the role of academia in fostering democratic discourse.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our arguments clearly connect faculty advocacy with public understanding and impact, contrasting with the opposition's narrow view of academia's responsibilities.  \n- The strength of our case lies in the demonstrable benefits incurred by professors advocating for public policies based on their expertise, which fosters greater societal engagement and promotes informed citizenry.\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The balance between academic credibility against public agency is central to this debate, alongside the value of advocacy for authenticity in teaching.  \n- The quality and relevance of the evidence supporting the necessity of public engagement will ultimately outweigh the opposition\u2019s concerns about perceived neutrality.  \n**Why We Win:**  \n- We have shown that advocacy does not inherently undercut academic objectivity but can enrich the educational mission, demonstrating that while it presents challenges, these may be addressed through informed and careful engagement.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \n- Our position supports the idea that professors should not only engage in advocacy but that doing so is fundamental to their role in society, promoting an informed public that benefits from their expertise. This is vital for fostering a truly representative and engaged democracy, affirming the motion that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise.",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH**\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nAt this stage of the debate, it's essential to delineate the core question at hand: Should professors actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise? The key decisions that matter involve recognizing the critical role of academia in society, evaluating the implications of professors' public engagement, and understanding how their expertise can positively influence public discourse. The debate should be evaluated based on the broader impacts of professors advocating for informed discussions that lead to societal progress and public empowerment.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim by Opposition:** \"Professors engaging in public advocacy risks undermining their credibility as objective educators and researchers.\"\n\n**Our Case Strength:**\n- The evidence presented by the Proposition shows that engaging in advocacy not only showcases the expertise of professors but can bolster their credibility when they advocate for their research. We have cited numerous studies\u2014from the opinions expressed by 78% of professors in the *Journal of Higher Education* to real-world instances like Dr. Michael Mann\u2014where professors\u2019 involvement in advocacy has positively shaped public understanding and policy initiatives.\n- The diversity of student opinions does not create a universal truth that professors lose credibility. Rather, it highlights the necessity for professors to engage thoughtfully and to maintain rigor in their arguments to enhance their reputations.\n\n**Their Response Gaps:**\n- The Opposition's claims that advocacy equals diminished credibility overlook successful advocacy examples where professors have enhanced their credibility through their involvement and visibility in meaningful discussions.\n- They fail to address how nuanced advocacy\u2014based on evidence and expertise\u2014can enrich academic standing and student engagement rather than detract from it.\n\n**Crucial Impact:**\n- This clash matters significantly because it discerns the notion of academic credibility. If we accept that professors can maintain open, objective dialogue while advocating, we reinforce the value of informed educators contributing to public discourse, allowing society to benefit from their unique insights and research.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim by Opposition:** \"Public advocacy by professors diverts time and resources away from their primary responsibilities of teaching and research.\"\n\n**Our Case Strength:**\n- The engagement in advocacy enhances the educational mission of professors by providing real-world relevance to academic discussions rather than competing with them. For instance, Dr. Stephanie Kelton's advocacy for Modern Monetary Theory did not distract her but enriched the course content and generated excitement and greater engagement among students.\n- Evidence supports that advocacy serves as a bridge to applying theoretical knowledge practically, asserting that professors can wear multiple hats and excel in various roles without sacrificing their primary responsibilities.\n\n**Their Response Gaps:**\n- The Opposition does not adequately counter the argument that academic engagement through advocacy often inspires and informs classroom discussions, which are critical for student development and enhancing educational quality.\n- They neglect to consider that advocacy can lead to the emergence of new research agendas and teaching methodologies that benefit both faculty and students.\n\n**Crucial Impact:**\n- The significance of this clash lies in how the evolving nature of academic responsibilities includes public engagement, thereby enhancing knowledge production rather than reducing it; it marks the academia\u2019s vital role in social progress.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim by Opposition:** \"Professors\u2019 expertise does not inherently qualify them to address broader social and political issues beyond their specialized fields.\"\n\n**Our Case Strength:**\n- The ability for professors to engage in broader social issues stems from their extensive expertise and ability to apply their knowledge critically. The examples of well-known academics who successfully intersect their specialized research with public advocacy prove that scholars are equipped to participate in meaningful discussions, as long as they ground their arguments in evidence.\n- The interdisciplinary dialogue emphasizes that many complex issues require insights from various fields, and professors can bring valuable perspectives that contribute positively to public discourse.\n\n**Their Response Gaps:**\n- The argument presented by the Opposition fails to recognize that the specialized knowledge of professors often brings forth necessary critiques and solutions in public debates. Their examples of missteps do not invalidate the principle of robust academic dialogue; they merely highlight the need for more precise engagement.\n- They do not discuss the fundamental value these professors bring into discussions that transcend their fields, impacting wider societal understanding and policymaking.\n\n**Crucial Impact:**\n- Winning this point reinforces our stance that professors improve public discourse by sharing their expertise, fostering informed citizenship and enriching societal debates, thereby underscoring the essential role of professors in contemporary discourse.\n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:**\n- The most vital clashes pertain to the credibility override versus the necessity of contributions to the public discourse and the redefinition of academic responsibilities in advocacy.\n  \n**Case Proof:**\n- Winning our points regarding the positive reinforcement of academic credibility, enriching educational outcomes, and enhancing societal understanding provides a robust case for the motion. Each of these points directly supports the proposition that professors should be active advocates in their fields.\n\n**Final Weighing:**\n- Even if the opposition presents a case on objectivity or expertise limitations, these arguments do not outweigh the overarching importance of public engagement by academics. The proven impacts that we provide, rooted in evidence, illustrate that professors' advocacy fosters more informed citizens and progresses crucial discussions in society.\n- The aggregate nature of our victories creates a compelling justification for supporting the proposition, demonstrating the undeniable benefits of such academic involvement.\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, the weight of the evidence and the impact of the arguments presented solidly affirm that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise. Their engagement is not only beneficial but essential to fostering a well-informed, engaged citizenry and creating a richer dialogue around critical issues that affect society. Therefore, I urge you to vote in favor of the motion. Thank you."

      "opening": "**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Professors engaging in public advocacy risks undermining their credibility as objective educators and researchers.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- In 2017, James Damore, a Google engineer, was fired after writing a controversial memo criticizing diversity policies. The incident sparked widespread debate, with academics weighing in on both sides. However, a study published in *Nature* (2019) found that public statements by professors often led to polarized perceptions among students, with 68% of surveyed students reporting they trusted professors less if they expressed strong political views.  \n- Another example is Professor Jordan Peterson, whose vocal opposition to Canadian Bill C-16 triggered heated public backlash. While some viewed him as courageous, others accused him of promoting harmful ideologies. A subsequent survey of Canadian university students showed a 40% decline in perceived neutrality of professors who took public stances on divisive issues.  \n- These cases demonstrate the real-world consequences of professors losing their perceived objectivity when engaging in advocacy, which can harm student trust and academic integrity.  \nConnection: This evidence shows that when professors advocate publicly, it jeopardizes their ability to be seen as impartial educators, which is essential for maintaining academic rigor and fostering open discussion.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Public advocacy by professors diverts time and resources away from their primary responsibilities of teaching and research.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n- The core principle of academia is the advancement of knowledge through teaching and scholarly work. Universities allocate substantial funding, facilities, and sabbaticals to support professors in these endeavors. When professors engage extensively in public advocacy, they shift focus away from this primary mission.  \n- For instance, in 2020, economist Dr. Stephanie Kelton spent months advocating for Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) across media platforms. While MMT gained public attention, critics noted that her university courses suffered due to her reduced availability, affecting student learning outcomes.  \n- Furthermore, universities themselves face resource allocation challenges. If professors prioritize advocacy over teaching or research, institutions must either hire replacements or risk declining educational quality.  \nConnection: By emphasizing the principle of prioritizing academic duties, this argument shows how public advocacy compromises the foundational purpose of higher education, leading to tangible losses in educational value.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Professors\u2019 expertise does not inherently qualify them to address broader social and political issues beyond their specialized fields.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- In 2021, Dr. Scott Atlas, a radiologist with no formal training in epidemiology, publicly advocated for controversial pandemic policies, including herd immunity strategies. His statements were widely criticized by public health experts and led to misinformation spreading among the public.  \n- Similarly, physicist Dr. Michio Kaku has frequently commented on sociopolitical topics like climate change policy. However, a 2022 analysis in *Scientific American* revealed that many of his proposals lacked grounding in actual climate science, undermining public understanding of the issue.  \n- This pattern highlights how professors stepping outside their narrow expertise can contribute to confusion and misinformation, even when well-intentioned.  \nConnection: The evidence underscores that expertise in one field does not equate to authority in broader societal debates. As such, professors engaging in public advocacy risk promoting flawed or incomplete perspectives, which harms public discourse.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \n- My arguments work together to demonstrate that professors engaging in public advocacy harms academic credibility, distracts from their core duties, and risks spreading misinformation.  \n- Together, these points prove that professors should refrain from actively participating in social and political advocacy, as doing so jeopardizes the very foundations of academia: trust, focus, and expertise.  \n- The real-world impact is significant\u2014without professors maintaining objectivity and prioritizing their role as educators, universities risk becoming politicized institutions rather than bastions of unbiased knowledge.  \n- By upholding the principles of neutrality and academic rigor, we ensure that higher education remains a space for open inquiry and intellectual growth, benefiting society at large.  \n\nThis unified case clearly supports our position against the motion.",
      "rebuttal": "**OPPOSITION REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Professors have a responsibility to leverage their expertise to inform and educate the public on critical social and political issues.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:**  \nEvidence Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe Proposition's claim relies heavily on evidence, but there are key flaws in its application and relevance. Specifically:  \n1. **Misinterpretation of Survey Data**: The Proposition cites a 2019 *Journal of Higher Education* study showing that 78% of professors believe they should engage in public debates. However, this statistic only reflects professors' opinions, not the outcomes or consequences of such engagement. Self-reported beliefs are not sufficient to prove actual effectiveness or justify a universal mandate for advocacy. If professors believe something is beneficial, it does not automatically mean it is beneficial in practice.  \n   \n2. **Selective Case Studies**: The example of Professor Robert Putnam and Dr. Michael Mann are cherry-picked successes that fail to account for the broader risks of advocacy. For instance, while Putnam's work may have influenced policy positively, other cases, like Dr. Scott Atlas (cited in our opening), demonstrate how professors' advocacy can lead to harmful misinformation when they step outside their fields of expertise. The Proposition fails to address these counterexamples, creating an incomplete and biased picture.  \n\n3. **Causality vs. Correlation**: The Proposition assumes causation between professors' advocacy and tangible results (e.g., legislative measures). However, there is no direct evidence provided to prove that Dr. Michael Mann\u2019s advocacy caused specific policy changes. Correlation does not imply causation, yet the Proposition uses it as a cornerstone of their argument.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point is crucial because it dismantles the Proposition's central premise\u2014that professors' advocacy is inherently beneficial. By exposing the flaws in their evidence, we undermine their claim that professors have a \"responsibility\" to engage in advocacy. This shifts the burden back to them to provide stronger, more comprehensive evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Engaging in public advocacy enhances the societal role of academia, bridging the gap between theory and practice.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:**  \nPrinciple Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe Proposition argues based on the principle of \"public intellectualism,\" suggesting that professors must advocate to contribute to societal discussions. However, this principle is overly broad and assumes advocacy is the only way for academics to fulfill their societal role. Specifically:  \n\n1. **Limitations of Public Intellectualism**: The principle ignores the diversity of roles within academia. Not all professors are\u2014or should be\u2014public intellectuals. Many excel in specialized research or teaching rather than public advocacy. Forcing all professors into a one-size-fits-all model undermines the multifaceted nature of academia and risks alienating those who prefer traditional academic contributions.  \n\n2. **False Dichotomy**: The Proposition implies that without advocacy, professors cannot influence society. This is incorrect. Professors already contribute to societal progress through rigorous peer-reviewed publications, curriculum development, and mentoring future leaders. For example, groundbreaking research published in journals often informs policymakers without requiring direct public statements from authors.  \n\n3. **Historical Context Overgeneralization**: The reference to Noam Chomsky is problematic because his influence stems from decades of scholarly work, not merely public advocacy. Chomsky's activism complements\u2014but does not replace\u2014his academic contributions. The Proposition overstates the importance of advocacy by conflating the two.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nThis point is vital because it exposes the narrowness of the Proposition's framework. If advocacy is not the sole or primary way for professors to contribute to society, their entire argument falls apart. By critiquing the principle of public intellectualism, we highlight alternative\u2014and equally valid\u2014ways for professors to serve the public good.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Public advocacy by professors serves to democratize knowledge and increase public engagement in critical issues.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:**  \nCounter Evidence  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe Proposition argues that advocacy democratizes knowledge, but this claim is contradicted by stronger evidence showing the opposite effect. Specifically:  \n\n1. **Polarization and Misinformation**: A 2019 *Nature* study (referenced in our opening) found that public statements by professors often lead to polarized perceptions among students, with 68% reporting reduced trust in educators who express strong political views. This undermines the idea that advocacy increases public understanding; instead, it deepens divisions and skepticism toward academia.  \n\n2. **Case of Dr. Michio Kaku**: As previously highlighted, Dr. Kaku's comments on climate change policy lacked grounding in actual climate science, according to a 2022 *Scientific American* analysis. Rather than democratizing knowledge, his statements spread misconceptions, illustrating how advocacy can distort rather than clarify complex issues.  \n\n3. **Institutional Backlash**: Universities themselves face reputational risks when professors engage in advocacy. For example, during the tenure controversy surrounding Professor Jordan Peterson, his university experienced significant backlash, affecting its standing and funding. This demonstrates how advocacy can alienate stakeholders rather than foster engagement.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point discredits the Proposition's claim that advocacy democratizes knowledge. By presenting counterexamples and highlighting polarization, we show that advocacy often achieves the opposite of what the Proposition claims, weakening their entire argument.\n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- Our first argument about professors losing objectivity could be challenged by emphasizing professors' ability to remain neutral while advocating.  \n- Opponents might argue that professors could balance advocacy with teaching and research, undermining our second point about resource diversion.  \n- They may also claim that professors are uniquely qualified to discuss interdisciplinary issues, contesting our third argument.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Reinforce the *Nature* study to demonstrate consistent findings of reduced student trust due to advocacy.  \n- Highlight the principle of academic specialization, emphasizing that professors are trained experts in narrow fields, not generalists equipped for broad societal debates.  \n- Provide further examples, such as Dr. Scott Atlas's advocacy leading to public health confusion, to bolster our position on misinformation.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nWe have systematically refuted each of the Proposition's arguments by critiquing their evidence, challenging their principles, and presenting stronger opposing evidence. Our responses are grounded in real-world consequences, making them more compelling than their theoretical claims. By addressing vulnerabilities and reinforcing our arguments, we ensure our position remains robust.\n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The quality and relevance of evidence regarding professors' advocacy effectiveness.  \n- The validity of the \"public intellectualism\" principle versus alternative academic roles.  \n- Whether advocacy democratizes knowledge or fosters polarization and misinformation.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \nOur rebuttals expose fundamental flaws in the Proposition's case, including weak evidence, limited principles, and counterproductive outcomes of advocacy. By focusing on tangible harms\u2014such as reduced academic credibility, resource misallocation, and misinformation\u2014we provide a clearer and more convincing argument against the motion.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these key clash points proves that professors engaging in public advocacy jeopardizes academic integrity and societal trust. Our position ensures that universities remain spaces of intellectual rigor and unbiased inquiry, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.  \n\n--- \n\n**FINAL REMARKS:**  \nYour Honor, we urge you to reject the Proposition's case and uphold the Opposition's position that professors should refrain from active public advocacy.",
      "closing": "**OPPOSITION FINAL SPEECH**\n\n---\n\n### **FRAMING**\n\nThe core issue in this debate is whether professors engaging in public advocacy strengthens or undermines the fundamental purposes of academia. This motion demands we evaluate three critical questions:  \n1. Does advocacy enhance or diminish the credibility of professors as objective educators?  \n2. Should the core responsibilities of professors\u2014teaching and research\u2014take precedence over public engagement?  \n3. Can professors reliably contribute to broader societal debates without risking misinformation or overreach?  \n\nTo assess this motion fairly, we must weigh the evidence, principles, and real-world consequences presented throughout the debate. The stakes are high: the integrity of academic institutions and the quality of public discourse hang in the balance. A vote for the Proposition risks politicizing academia and diluting scholarly rigor, while a vote for the Opposition safeguards the neutrality and focus essential to higher education.\n\n---\n\n### **KEY CLASHES**\n\n#### **CLASH POINT 1: Academic Credibility Versus Polarization**\n**Quote from Proposition:** \"Professors have a responsibility to leverage their expertise to inform and educate the public on critical social and political issues.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Our evidence directly refutes this claim. A 2019 *Nature* study found that 68% of students trust professors less when they express strong political views. This is not merely a perception issue; it has tangible consequences for academic integrity. Professors are expected to foster open, unbiased environments where students feel free to explore diverse perspectives. Advocacy risks alienating students and stifling dialogue, particularly on divisive issues.  \n- Furthermore, the case of Professor Jordan Peterson illustrates how advocacy polarizes public opinion, with backlash affecting both the professor and their institution. Such outcomes undermine the very trust and credibility academia depends on.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The Proposition failed to address the *Nature* study's findings and instead dismissed concerns about polarization as anecdotal. They also relied on isolated success stories, like Robert Putnam, to argue for universal advocacy. This ignores the many cases where advocacy backfires, as with Dr. Scott Atlas, whose pandemic-related statements spread harmful misinformation.  \n- The Proposition also conflated advocacy with scholarly publication, ignoring that peer-reviewed research achieves societal impact without jeopardizing objectivity.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWinning this clash proves that advocacy harms academic credibility, undermining the foundation of trust between professors and students. A neutral academic environment is indispensable for fostering intellectual growth and open inquiry.\n\n---\n\n#### **CLASH POINT 2: Prioritizing Teaching and Research Over Advocacy**\n**Quote from Proposition:** \"Engaging in public advocacy enhances the societal role of academia, bridging the gap between theory and practice.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The core principle of academia is advancing knowledge through teaching and research. Universities allocate significant resources to support these endeavors, and professors who prioritize advocacy divert attention from their primary duties. For instance, Dr. Stephanie Kelton's extensive media appearances on Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) reportedly affected her availability for teaching, illustrating the trade-offs involved.  \n- Our argument highlights that advocacy is not inherently educational. While public engagement may raise awareness, it cannot replace the depth and rigor of scholarly work. Advocacy risks turning professors into activists rather than educators, diminishing the quality of teaching and research.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The Proposition argued that advocacy enriches education by bringing real-world relevance into classrooms. However, this is a flawed assumption. Advocacy introduces bias into curricula, framing issues through a single lens rather than encouraging critical evaluation. Moreover, the Proposition failed to explain how professors could balance advocacy with their existing heavy workloads without compromising either.  \n- They also failed to refute the resource allocation challenge, ignoring the financial implications of professors shifting focus away from teaching and research.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nThis clash is decisive because it demonstrates that advocacy undermines the foundational mission of academia. Prioritizing teaching and research ensures that universities produce well-rounded graduates and maintain their status as bastions of knowledge, benefiting society far more than sporadic advocacy efforts.\n\n---\n\n#### **CLASH POINT 3: Expertise and Its Limits**\n**Quote from Proposition:** \"Public advocacy by professors serves to democratize knowledge and increase public engagement in critical issues.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Our evidence shows that professors\u2019 expertise does not inherently qualify them to address broader societal issues outside their specialized fields. For example, Dr. Michio Kaku's comments on climate change policy were criticized for lacking scientific grounding, leading to public confusion. Similarly, Dr. Scott Atlas's advocacy caused widespread misinformation during a global health crisis.  \n- These examples underscore the importance of academic humility. Advocacy requires contextualizing complex issues, yet stepping outside one's expertise increases the risk of oversimplification or error. This harms public understanding and erodes the legitimacy of academic voices.  \n\n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The Proposition argued that interdisciplinary dialogue enriches public discourse, but they failed to address the dangers of professors speaking beyond their expertise. While interdisciplinary engagement is valuable, it must be grounded in rigorous evidence and careful framing. Advocacy, however, incentivizes professors to make sweeping claims without sufficient qualification.  \n- Additionally, the Proposition ignored our example of Dr. Atlas, failing to explain how professors could avoid spreading misinformation when engaging in advocacy.  \n\n**Crucial Impact:**  \nWinning this clash proves that professors\u2019 advocacy risks spreading misinformation and distorting public discourse. By limiting advocacy to specialized expertise, we protect both academic integrity and societal trust.\n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**\n\n#### **Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most critical clashes are:  \n1. Academic credibility versus polarization \u2014 ensuring neutrality is essential for maintaining trust in academia.  \n2. Prioritizing teaching and research over advocacy \u2014 universities exist to advance knowledge, not to serve as platforms for activism.  \n\n#### **Case Proof:**  \n- Our evidence, including the *Nature* study and cases of Dr. Atlas and Dr. Kaku, directly supports our position.  \n- Each clash aligns with the core principles of academia: objectivity, rigor, and specialization. Winning these points proves that professors should refrain from advocacy to uphold the integrity of higher education.  \n\n#### **Final Weighing:**  \n- While the Proposition presented theoretical benefits of advocacy, their evidence was weak and selective. They failed to substantiate causation, address real-world harms, or refute our arguments convincingly.  \n- Even if professors successfully engage in advocacy in some cases, the risks outweigh the rewards. A handful of success stories cannot justify jeopardizing the foundational principles of academia.  \n\nYour Honor, rejecting the Proposition's case affirms the Opposition's position that professors should prioritize their core responsibilities and maintain objectivity. A vote for the Opposition ensures that universities remain spaces of intellectual rigor and unbiased inquiry, serving society's best interests in the long run.  \n\nThank you."

**Proposition's Rebuttal:** Challenges the generalizability of the Opposition's evidence but does not sufficiently counter the pervasive decline in trust highlighted by the Opposition.\n  - **Opposition's Rebuttal:** Effectively undermines the Proposition's claims by emphasizing the significant negative impact on trust and objectivity.\n\n- **Clash Decision:** **Opposition Wins**\n  - *Justification:* The Opposition provides robust empirical evidence demonstrating a systemic decline in trust and credibility among students when professors engage in public advocacy, outweighing the Proposition's selective positive instances.\n\n**Clash 2: Effect on Professors' Primary Responsibilities**\n\n- **Proposition's Position:**\n  - *Quote:* \"The engagement in advocacy enhances the educational mission of professors by providing real-world relevance to academic discussions rather than competing with them.\"\n  - *Analysis:* The Proposition asserts that advocacy enriches teaching by integrating practical applications, thereby enhancing educational outcomes.\n\n- **Opposition's Position:**\n  - *Quote:* \"Public advocacy by professors diverts time and resources away from their primary responsibilities of teaching and research.\"\n  - *Analysis:* The Opposition argues that advocacy consumes time and resources that should be dedicated to teaching and research, leading to compromised educational quality.\n\n- **Logical Validity:**\n  - **Proposition:** Presents a plausible argument that advocacy can complement teaching, though it may overlook potential resource constraints.\n  - **Opposition:** Provides a logically sound argument supported by specific examples where advocacy has detracted from teaching responsibilities.\n\n- **Quality of Evidence:**\n  - **Proposition:** Cites instances like Dr. Stephanie Kelton where advocacy enhances educational content, showing direct relevance.\n  - **Opposition:** References cases where advocacy led to reduced teaching availability and educational quality, demonstrating clear impact.\n\n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n  - **Proposition's Rebuttal:** Attempts to show that advocacy can coexist with teaching responsibilities but does not fully address the potential for resource diversion.\n  - **Opposition's Rebuttal:** Strongly reinforces the argument that advocacy imposes tangible costs on teaching and research, which are foundational to academia.\n\n- **Clash Decision:** **Opposition Wins**\n  - *Justification:* The Opposition effectively demonstrates that advocacy can detract from the core academic missions of teaching and research, supported by concrete examples, overshadowing the Proposition's claims of enrichment.\n\n**Clash 3: Expertise and Potential for Misinformation**\n\n- **Proposition's Position:**\n  - *Quote:* \"The ability for professors to engage with and contribute to societal discussions stems from their extensive expertise and ability to apply their knowledge critically.\"\n  - *Analysis:* The Proposition maintains that professors can responsibly apply their specialized knowledge to broader societal issues, enhancing public discourse.\n\n- **Opposition's Position:**\n  - *Quote:* \"Professors\u2019 expertise does not inherently qualify them to address broader social and political issues beyond their specialized fields.\"\n  - *Analysis:* The Opposition argues that when professors venture beyond their expertise, it can lead to misinformation and confusion among the public.\n\n- **Logical Validity:**\n  - **Proposition:** Presents a valid argument about the potential positive impact of applied expertise but may underestimate the risks of overstepping.\n  - **Opposition:** Provides a logically consistent argument highlighting the dangers of professors addressing issues outside their specialized knowledge areas.\n\n- **Quality of Evidence:**\n  - **Proposition:** Uses examples of successful interdisciplinary advocacy but lacks comprehensive evidence on potential pitfalls.\n  - **Opposition:** Cites specific instances (e.g., Dr. Scott Atlas, Dr. Michio Kaku) where professors' advocacy led to misinformation, offering robust evidence.\n\n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n  - **Proposition's Rebuttal:** Acknowledges isolated missteps but argues for the overall benefit of advocacy, which does not fully mitigate the Opposition's concerns.\n  - **Opposition's Rebuttal:** Effectively counters by showcasing how advocacy can lead to misinformation, reinforcing the argument against overextension of expertise.\n\n- **Clash Decision:** **Opposition Wins**\n  - *Justification:* The Opposition provides compelling evidence that when professors engage beyond their expertise, it can result in significant misinformation, thereby weakening the Proposition's stance on responsible advocacy.\n\n<I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact>\n\n- **Proposition's Core Arguments:**\n  1. **Responsibility to Advocate:** Professors should leverage their expertise to inform and educate the public.\n     - *Impact:* Fosters an informed society and shapes public policy positively.\n  2. **Enhancement of Academic Roles:** Advocacy bridges theory and practice, enriching societal engagement.\n     - *Impact:* Validates the societal role of academia and applies research to real-world problems.\n  3. **Democratization of Knowledge:** Advocacy increases public engagement and accessibility of complex issues.\n     - *Impact:* Creates a more informed and engaged citizenry.\n\n- **Opposition's Core Arguments:**\n  1. **Undermining Credibility:** Advocacy risks diminishing professors' objectivity and credibility.\n     - *Impact:* Erodes trust in academia and stifles open dialogue.\n  2. **Diverting Resources:** Advocacy consumes time and resources meant for teaching and research.\n     - *Impact:* Compromises educational quality and academic integrity.\n  3. **Risk of Misinformation:** Professors may spread misinformation when addressing issues beyond their expertise.\n     - *Impact:* Distorts public discourse and harms societal understanding.\n\n- **Relative Importance:**\n  - The Opposition's arguments on credibility and resource diversion are paramount as they strike at the foundational missions of academia\u2014maintaining trust and advancing knowledge.\n  - The risk of misinformation, while critical, serves as an extension of the credibility argument, reinforcing its significance.\n\n<I.3 Consistency and Contradictions>\n\n- **Opposition's Case Consistency:**\n  - Maintains a consistent stance against advocacy by systematically addressing the negative impacts on credibility, resources, and information accuracy.\n  \n- **Proposition's Case Consistency:**\n  - While the Proposition presents a unified positive case for advocacy, it exhibits a selective focus on successful instances without addressing broader systemic risks highlighted by the Opposition.\n\n- **Dropped Arguments:**\n  - Both sides adequately address their core arguments throughout the debate. There are no significant dropped arguments that remain unaddressed.\n\n</I>\n\n<II. Evaluation Requirements>\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides presented their strongest possible arguments. The Opposition effectively highlighted empirical evidence against advocacy, while the Proposition showcased the potential benefits through specific cases.\n\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The decision relies solely on the arguments presented within the debate, without introducing external information.\n\n- **Ignore Presentation:** The analysis focused exclusively on the substance of the arguments, disregarding any rhetorical elements.\n\n- **Framework Neutrality:** Each side operated within its chosen framework, with the Opposition focusing on the integrity and foundational missions of academia, and the Proposition emphasizing the societal benefits of advocacy.\n\n</II>\n\n<III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID>\n\n- **No Intervention:** The analysis did not introduce any personal arguments or evidence outside the provided debate texts.\n\n- **No Shifting of Burden of Proof:** Both sides were evaluated based on their presented arguments without altering the burden of proof.\n\n- **No Over-Reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** Both principled and practical arguments were equally considered based on their relevance and quality.\n\n- **No Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** All significant arguments from both sides were addressed.\n\n- **No Double-Counting:** Each argument was evaluated uniquely without overlapping assessments.\n\n- **No Assumption of Causation from Correlation:** The analysis respected the distinction between causation and correlation as presented in the arguments.\n\n</III>\n\n<IV. Decision Making>\n\n- **Winner:** Opposition\n\n- **Confidence Level:** 80\n\n- **Key Factors:**\n  1. **Empirical Evidence on Credibility:** The Opposition provided strong, empirical evidence demonstrating that public advocacy leads to a significant decline in trust and credibility among students, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of academic institutions.\n  2. **Resource Diversion Impact:** The Opposition effectively illustrated how advocacy diverts essential resources away from teaching and research, directly undermining the core missions of academia.\n  3. **Risk of Misinformation:** By presenting cases where professors' advocacy led to misinformation, the Opposition reinforced the argument that advocacy can harm public discourse and societal understanding.\n\n- **Detailed Reasoning:**\n  - The Opposition consistently presented well-supported arguments highlighting the detrimental effects of public advocacy on academic credibility, resource allocation, and information accuracy.\n  - The Proposition\u2019s arguments, while valid, relied on selective positive instances that did not sufficiently counterbalance the broader systemic issues raised by the Opposition.\n  - The rebuttals from the Opposition further solidified their stance by effectively dismantling the Proposition\u2019s claims and reinforcing their own position with additional evidence.\n  - Overall, the Opposition\u2019s case was more comprehensive and impactful, addressing the foundational aspects of academia that are threatened by public advocacy.\n\n</IV>\n\n<V. Line-by-Line Justification>\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** Addressed the responsibility of professors to engage in advocacy, supported by evidence and case studies demonstrating positive impacts on public discourse and policy.\n  \n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** Presented arguments on how advocacy undermines credibility, diverts resources, and risks spreading misinformation, supported by empirical studies and real-world examples.\n  \n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** Attempted to critique the Opposition's evidence by questioning its generalizability and emphasizing the benefits of advocacy, but did not fully counteract the systemic issues raised.\n  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** Strengthened initial arguments by highlighting flaws in the Proposition\u2019s claims, reinforcing the negative impacts of advocacy on trust, resource allocation, and information integrity.\n  \n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** Reiterated the benefits of advocacy, addressed key clash points by emphasizing enhanced credibility and educational enrichment, but was unable to sufficiently mitigate the Opposition\u2019s concerns.\n  \n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** Consolidated the case against advocacy by emphasizing the risks to academic credibility, resource diversion, and misinformation, effectively countering the Proposition\u2019s arguments with robust evidence and logical reasoning.\n\n</V>"

      "logic": "## I. Core Judging Principles\n\n### I.1 Direct Clash Resolution\n\n#### **Clash 1: Credibility of Professors Engaging in Public Advocacy**\n\n- **Proposition's Position:** Engaging in public advocacy showcases professors' expertise and can bolster their credibility. Example: Dr. Michael Mann's advocacy led to significant legislative measures.\n  \n- **Opposition's Position:** Public advocacy risks undermining professors' credibility as objective educators. Evidence: 68% of students trust professors less when they express strong political views (*Nature*, 2019).\n\n- **Logical Validity:** \n  - **Proposition:** Logical if advocacy is based on expertise, it can enhance credibility.\n  - **Opposition:** Logical if advocacy is perceived as biased, it can undermine credibility.\n  \n- **Quality of Evidence:**\n  - **Proposition:** Uses specific cases and a study showing professors' willingness to engage in advocacy.\n  - **Opposition:** Cites a reputable study linking advocacy to reduced student trust and specific high-profile cases demonstrating backlash.\n  \n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n  - **Proposition Rebuttal:** Critiques the Opposition's evidence as anecdotal and emphasizes that advocacy can enhance credibility.\n  - **Opposition Rebuttal:** Reinforces the *Nature* study and provides additional examples of reduced trust and misinformation.\n  \n- **Winner of the Clash:** **Opposition**\n  \n- **Justification:** The Opposition provides more robust and directly relevant evidence showing a significant negative impact on credibility, which is critical for the foundational role of professors.\n\n#### **Clash 2: Allocation of Time and Resources**\n\n- **Proposition's Position:** Public advocacy enriches education by making it more relevant. Example: Dr. Stephanie Kelton's advocacy on Modern Monetary Theory enhances classroom discussions.\n  \n- **Opposition's Position:** Public advocacy diverts time and resources away from teaching and research. Example: Dr. Stephanie Kelton's reduced availability affected student learning outcomes.\n  \n- **Logical Validity:** Both positions are logically valid, addressing whether advocacy complements or competes with primary academic duties.\n  \n- **Quality of Evidence:**\n  - **Proposition:** Provides a specific example where advocacy enriched education.\n  - **Opposition:** Provides a counter-example where advocacy negatively impacted academic responsibilities.\n  \n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n  - **Proposition Rebuttal:** Argues that advocacy can enhance educational outcomes and does not necessarily detract from primary duties.\n  - **Opposition Rebuttal:** Emphasizes that advocacy introduces bias and sacrifices academic rigor.\n  \n- **Winner of the Clash:** **Opposition**\n  \n- **Justification:** The Opposition effectively demonstrates tangible negative consequences of advocacy diverting essential academic resources, which is a critical concern for educational integrity.\n\n#### **Clash 3: Expertise and Its Applicability to Broader Issues**\n\n- **Proposition's Position:** Professors can apply their specialized knowledge to broader social and political issues, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue.\n  \n- **Opposition's Position:** Professors engaging beyond their expertise can lead to misinformation and confusion. Examples: Dr. Scott Atlas and Dr. Michio Kaku disseminating flawed information.\n  \n- **Logical Validity:** The Opposition presents a valid concern about overstepping expertise, which can lead to misinformation.\n  \n- **Quality of Evidence:**\n  - **Proposition:** Argues for the positive interdisciplinary impact with examples.\n  - **Opposition:** Provides specific instances where advocacy led to misinformation from experts outside their primary fields.\n  \n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n  - **Proposition Rebuttal:** Suggests interdisciplinary dialogue is beneficial and that isolated missteps do not invalidate the principle.\n  - **Opposition Rebuttal:** Reinforces the risks of overstepping expertise and the resultant misinformation.\n  \n- **Winner of the Clash:** **Opposition**\n  \n- **Justification:** The Opposition successfully highlights significant risks associated with professors overstepping their expertise, undermining public discourse, which outweighs the potential interdisciplinary benefits.\n\n### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n- **Opposition's Core Arguments:**\n  1. **Credibility Undermined:** Professors lose objectivity and trust when engaging in advocacy.\n  2. **Resource Diversion:** Advocacy diverts time and resources from teaching and research.\n  3. **Misinformation Risks:** Professors may spread misinformation when addressing issues beyond their expertise.\n\n- **Proposition's Core Arguments:**\n  1. **Enhancing Societal Role:** Advocacy bridges theory and practice, making academia more relevant.\n  2. **Democratizing Knowledge:** Advocacy increases public engagement and understanding of critical issues.\n  3. **Responsibility to Inform:** Professors have a duty to leverage their expertise for public good.\n\n- **Logical Links and Impact:**\n  - The Opposition\u2019s arguments are interlinked, each supporting the overarching claim that advocacy undermines academic integrity and effectiveness.\n  - The Proposition\u2019s arguments aim to establish the positive societal role of academia through advocacy but are less interconnected in addressing the potential negatives.\n\n- **Relative Importance:** \n  - **Opposition:** All three core arguments directly challenge the foundational role of professors and the integrity of academia.\n  - **Proposition:** While impactful, the arguments do not sufficiently counter the Opposition\u2019s concerns about credibility and resource allocation.\n\n### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions\n\n- **Opposition:**\n  - **Consistency:** Maintains a consistent stance that advocacy harms academic integrity and effectiveness.\n  - **No internal contradictions** detected.\n  - **Dropped Arguments:** None identified; all main points were addressed.\n\n- **Proposition:**\n  - **Consistency:** Advocates for the positive role of advocacy but may overstate the benefits without fully addressing the potential downsides.\n  - **Possible Contradiction:** Balancing advocacy with maintaining objectivity can be challenging, potentially undermining their own position.\n  - **Dropped Arguments:** Limited focus on how to mitigate the negative impacts of advocacy on credibility and resource allocation.\n\n## II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides presented their strongest arguments, with the Proposition emphasizing positive impacts and the Opposition highlighting critical downsides.\n  \n- **Argument-Based Decision:** Decision based solely on the debate content without introducing external knowledge.\n  \n- **Ignore Presentation:** Focused strictly on substance, disregarding rhetorical styles.\n  \n- **Framework Neutrality:** Maintained neutrality in evaluating each side\u2019s framework without bias.\n\n## III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\n- **No Intervention:** Did not introduce new arguments or evidence.\n  \n- **No Shifting Burden of Proof:** Evaluated both sides equally based on their presented claims.\n  \n- **Balanced Evaluation:** Did not over-rely on real-world examples but assessed their relevance and quality.\n  \n- **Addressed Dropped Arguments:** Analyzed the Proposition's limited response to potential negative impacts.\n  \n- **No Double-Counting:** Each argument was considered once within its respective clash.\n  \n- **Causation vs. Correlation:** The Opposition effectively differentiated between perceived impacts and actual causation regarding credibility.\n\n## IV. Decision Making\n\n<winnerName>Opposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>80</confidence>\n\n- **Confidence Level:** 80 \u2013 Clear Victory\n\n- **Key Factors:**\n  1. **Credibility Undermined:** Strong evidence from reputable studies showing reduced trust in professors when engaging in advocacy.\n  2. **Resource Diversion:** Clear examples of advocacy negatively impacting teaching and research responsibilities.\n  3. **Misinformation Risks:** Concrete instances where professors overstepped expertise, leading to public confusion.\n\n- **Detailed Reasoning:**\n  The Opposition consistently provided robust evidence that public advocacy by professors can undermine their credibility, divert essential academic resources, and spread misinformation. These factors directly challenge the foundational roles of educators and researchers, which are critical to the integrity of academic institutions. While the Proposition offered valuable points about the positive societal role of advocacy, they lacked sufficient counter-evidence to address the substantial risks highlighted by the Opposition. The comprehensive nature of the Opposition\u2019s arguments, supported by specific studies and real-world examples, established a more persuasive case against the motion.\n\n## V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** Addressed professors\u2019 responsibility and societal impact through advocacy.\n  \n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** Highlighted risks to credibility, resource diversion, and expertise limitations.\n  \n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** Challenged the Opposition's evidence and defended the benefits of advocacy.\n  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** Reinforced the negative impacts of advocacy, including reduced trust and misinformation.\n  \n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** Emphasized key clashes and the positive influence of advocacy on credibility and education.\n  \n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** Focused on reinforcing the harm to credibility, resource allocation, and misinformation, countering the Proposition\u2019s claims effectively.\n\n## VI.
