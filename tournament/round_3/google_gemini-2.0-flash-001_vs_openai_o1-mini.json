    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "Okay, here is the opening speech for the proposition side of the motion: \"This House would limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights, requiring broader institutional and public ownership instead of allowing concentrated private control.\"\n\nOPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Concentrated ownership of social media platforms enables undue influence over public discourse and information accessibility, which harms democratic processes.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - Explain the key principle/framework: The cornerstone of democracy rests on the principle of equal opportunity in the marketplace of ideas. No single entity, especially a private individual, should possess the power to disproportionately shape the information landscape that informs public opinion and policy decisions. Unfettered control enables censorship, algorithmic manipulation, and the amplification of specific narratives benefiting the controlling shareholder's interests. This concentration of power directly contradicts the democratic ideal of a level playing field where diverse voices can compete fairly.\n  - Show why it is valid/important: The validity of this principle lies in the inherent dangers of unchecked power. History is replete with examples of concentrated media ownership being used to promote propaganda, suppress dissent, and undermine democratic institutions. The Cambridge Analytica scandal, where user data was harvested and used for targeted political advertising, exemplifies the threat. The importance of this principle is heightened in the digital age, where social media platforms serve as primary sources of news and information for billions. Losing control of the narrative is losing control of the democratic mandate.\n  - Demonstrate how it applies here: Currently figures like Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), Elon Musk (X), and others wield immense control over their platforms because of their large ownership stakes. This allows them to unilaterally decide what content is promoted, what voices are amplified or silenced, and how algorithms shape user experiences. Limiting individual shareholding to 15% diffuses this power, making it more difficult for one person to manipulate the flow of information for their own agenda. This will compel platforms to listen to a broader range of stakeholders. Ownership of this kind of control presents a clear and present threat to the integrity of democracies globally.\nConnection: This principle demonstrates that concentrated social media ownership is inherently dangerous. By limiting individual ownership, we uphold the democratic principle of equal access to information, mitigating the risk of manipulation and censorship currently unchecked under the current ownership model in social media. If one person can control the algorithm, they can control the narrative, so changing that control is vital for the integrity of democracy.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: Broader institutional and public ownership fosters greater accountability and responsiveness to societal needs, promoting ethical platform governance.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  For Evidence:\n  - Provide specific examples with dates/numbers: Consider the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation). This is a publicly owned media outlet with a charter that mandates impartiality and a commitment to serving the public interest. While not perfect, it demonstrates a model with a greater focus on balanced reporting and ethical standards compared to privately owned media often driven by profit motives. Studies (e.g., Curran, J. (2000). *Power without Responsibility: The Press and Broadcasting in Britain*. Routledge) have shown that publicly funded media tend to offer a wider range of perspectives and are less susceptible to commercial pressures than privately owned counterparts.\n  - Include real world cases and outcomes: The Mondragon Corporation in Spain, a worker-owned cooperative, provides another example of a successful model. It demonstrates that employee ownership leads to improved job satisfaction, higher productivity, and a stronger commitment to ethical business practices. Transferring elements of this model to social media, through institutional and public ownership, encourages greater responsibility to all stakeholders and will naturally create more accountability.\n  - Show clear relevance to the topic: By limiting individual shareholding and promoting institutional and public ownership, we encourage a shift in priorities from maximizing shareholder value to serving the public interest. Institutional investors, such as pension funds, are often more attuned to long-term social and environmental considerations, while public ownership ensures greater transparency and accountability through government oversight, thus giving agency to the public good.\nConnection: The evidence of BBC and Mondragon demonstrates the benefits of broader ownership models. By transitioning social media platforms from private control to a mixed model of institutional and public ownership, we create a system with greater accountability, ethical governance, and responsiveness to the needs of all stakeholders, fostering a healthier digital public square.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: Limiting individual shareholding reduces the risk of arbitrary and capricious decision-making that undermines platform stability and user trust.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - Explain the key principle/framework: The principle of checks and balances applies not just to government but also to powerful private entities that wield significant influence over society. No single individual should have absolute power, as this creates a risk of impulsive decisions driven by personal biases, whims, or short-term financial considerations. This is also supported by the well know psychological framework of CEO disease.\n  - Show why it is valid/important: Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter (now X) and his subsequent controversial decisions provide a stark warning. His sudden policy changes, content moderation choices, and reinstatement of previously banned accounts have created chaos, driven away advertisers, and eroded user trust. This highlights the dangers of entrusting such vast power to a single individual without adequate checks or balances.\n  - Demonstrate how it applies here: Limiting individual shareholding forces decisions to be made through a more collaborative and deliberative process, requiring the consideration of diverse perspectives and mitigating the risk of impulsive, self-serving actions. Institutional investors and public representatives will act as a check on management, ensuring that decisions are made in the long-term interest of the platform and its users.\nConnection: The example of Twitter under Elon Musk demonstrates the dangers of unchecked power. By limiting individual shareholding, we introduce necessary checks and balances, reducing the risk of arbitrary decisions that damage platform stability and user trust. This reduces the scope of a single actor's ability to enact such dramatic changes without considering stakeholder positions.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nOur arguments work together to present a unified case for democratizing control of social media platforms. Concentrated ownership undermines democratic discourse, broader ownership enhances accountability, and limited individual control reduces arbitrary decision-making. Taken together, these arguments demonstrate that limiting individual shareholding is essential for creating a more equitable, responsible, and sustainable digital public square. By implementing this policy, we safeguard democratic values, promote ethical platform governance, and build trust in the digital spaces where billions of people connect and share information. Focusing on the long-term benefits of this policy highlights key themes such as the integrity of public discourse, the importance of stakeholder input, and the overall health of democratic institutions. The current environment risks losing the democratic mandate.\n",
      "rebuttal": "Okay, here is the rebuttal speech for the proposition side of the motion: \"This House would limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights, requiring broader institutional and public ownership instead of allowing concentrated private control.\"\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\nOriginal Claim: \"Limiting individual shareholding to 15% voting rights undermines the principle of free market ownership and individual property rights.\"\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The opposition claims limiting shareholding undermines free market principles. However, this is a misapplication of the concept. Free markets are not absolute; they operate within regulatory frameworks designed to prevent monopolies and protect the public interest. Property rights are also not absolute; they are subject to reasonable restrictions, especially when their exercise harms society. Just as environmental regulations limit how landowners can use their property to prevent pollution, limiting shareholding is a reasonable restriction to prevent undue influence over public discourse, a critical public good. Their principle ignores the potential for concentrated power to corrupt the very market of ideas the free market is suppose to support.\nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it reframes the debate. It demonstrates that our proposal isn't an attack on free markets, but a necessary regulation to ensure a fair and democratic application of those principles in the digital age. It ensures that the theoretical right to ownership does not outweigh actual harm to democratic processes.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\nOriginal Claim: \"Broader institutional and public ownership can lead to inefficiencies and lack of accountability in corporate governance.\"\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\nChallenge: The opposition provides examples like WeWork to argue institutional ownership leads to poor governance. However, WeWork is an exception, not the rule, and their example lacks a crucial comparison: what alternative regulatory framework would have avoided the issues? Furthermore, our proposal involves *both* institutional and public ownership, creating a system of checks and balances. We presented the example of the BBC, which, despite imperfections, demonstrates a commitment to public service and balanced reporting that is often lacking in purely private media. Additionally they claim that hedge funds prioritize short-term gains, but this is because there are no other required stakeholders to consider, exactly a problem our proposal would resolve. Requiring greater input from institutional and public owners ensures considerations beyond quarterly profits. It also should be noted that the problems at WeWork were not problems for the public good, but for the sake of profit.\nImpact: Winning this point is critical because it directly counters the opposition's claim that broader ownership leads to inefficiency. Our evidence provides a real-world example of the opposite, demonstrating that a mixed ownership model can promote accountability and ethical governance.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\nOriginal Claim: \"Limiting individual shareholding restricts investment diversity and can stifle innovation within social media platforms.\"\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge: The opposition claims that limiting individual shareholding restricts investment diversity and stifles innovation. However, innovation isn't solely driven by large individual shareholders. It often comes from smaller startups and diverse teams within larger companies. Limiting individual shareholding will not stifle innovation, but rather push the platform to rely less on the whims of its single owner. With a more diverse group of stakeholders the platform would be forced to consider diverse needs. The principle of diverse investment is beneficial, but not if it causes a monopoly on information by way of a single controlling shareholder, making checks and balances impossible.\nImpact: Winning this point is important because negates the opposition's narrative that our proposal will stifle innovation. We show it, while perhaps disincentivizing a certain type of investment, will force companies to source expertise and value from a diverse range of other places, creating healthy diverse growth.\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\nVulnerabilities:\n- Our BBC and Mondragon examples might be seen as not directly analogous to social media platforms. The opposition could argue that social media operates in a fundamentally different environment.\n- The opposition may try to paint us as anti-free market, arguing that any restriction on individual ownership is inherently harmful.\nAdditional Support:\n- We can reinforce our argument by highlighting the increasing calls for regulation of social media platforms from both sides of the political spectrum. This demonstrates a broad recognition of the need for greater accountability and oversight.\n- We can further emphasize that our proposal is not about eliminating private ownership but rather about creating a balance of power to safeguard democratic values. A limit on individual shareholding promotes greater consideration of diverse perspectives.\nWhy We Prevail:\n- We directly clash with the opposition's arguments by providing counter-evidence and challenging their underlying principles.\n- We demonstrate that our proposal is a reasonable and necessary regulation to address the unique challenges posed by concentrated control of social media platforms.\n- We show that our plan will not stifle innovation, but rather encourage it through a more diverse and representative form of investment.\n\n**WEIGHING**\nKey Clash Points:\n- The most important disagreement revolves around the balance between individual property rights and the public interest. Does the right of an individual shareholder to control a social media platform outweigh the potential harm to democratic discourse and societal well-being?\n- The second key clash point concerns the impact of broader ownership on corporate governance. Will it lead to inefficiency and short-termism, as the opposition claims, or to greater accountability and ethical decision-making, as we argue?\nWhy We Win:\n- We win by showing that the potential harms of concentrated control outweigh the benefits of unrestricted individual ownership.\n- We demonstrate that limiting individual shareholding is not a radical departure from free market principles but a necessary regulation to protect the integrity of the democratic process.\nOverall Impact:\n- Winning these key points proves our case that limiting individual shareholding and promoting broader ownership is essential for creating a more equitable, responsible, and sustainable digital public square.\n- Our proposal safeguards democratic values, promotes ethical platform governance, and builds trust in the digital spaces where billions of people connect and share information.\n",
      "closing": "Okay, here is the closing speech for the proposition side of the motion: \"This House would limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights, requiring broader institutional and public ownership instead of allowing concentrated private control.\"\n\n**FRAMING**\nCore Questions:\n- Is concentrated power in the hands of a few acceptable in controlling public discourse, or should we prioritize a more democratized and accountable structure for social media platforms?\n- Does limiting individual shareholding infringe on free market principles to an unacceptable degree, or is it a necessary regulation to safeguard democratic values and public interest in the digital age?\n- Which ownership model \u2013 concentrated private, or broader institutional and public \u2013 is more conducive to ethical governance, platform stability, and user trust?\n\nKEY CLASHES\nHere are the key clashes to consider:\n\n**KEY CLASH 1**\nQuote: \"Limiting individual shareholding to 15% voting rights undermines the principle of free market ownership and individual property rights\" vs. \"Free markets are not absolute; they operate within regulatory frameworks designed to prevent monopolies and protect the public interest.\"\nOur Case Strength:\n- Our principle is stronger: Free markets exist to promote societal good, not to enable unchecked power that undermines the very foundations of democracy. We are not against free markets, but *for* regulating them to prevent monopolies of influence.\n- Direct comparison: The opposition argues an abstract principle. We argue the *application* of the principle. The right to own property doesn't extend to harming public discourse.\n- Superior reasoning: Their argument ignores precedent. Property rights, in numerous contexts, are limited for public good. Zoning laws, environmental regulations. This is no different.\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- They fail to address the core issue: that concentrated ownership in social media gives individuals undue influence over public discourse, a clear threat to democracy.\n- They haven't provided a clear alternative to prevent against censorship, algorithmic manipulation, and the amplification of specific narratives that harm democratic values.\n- They ignore the historical context of why regulations are placed on markets. To prevent unfair control.\nCrucial Impact:\n- This clash is paramount. If we win here, it establishes that limiting individual shareholding is not an infringement on free market principles, but a responsible regulation to protect the public interest and democratic values in the digital age.\n- It reframes the entire debate. We are not anti-market, but pro-democracy.\n\n**KEY CLASH 2**\nQuote: \"Broader institutional and public ownership can lead to inefficiencies and lack of accountability in corporate governance\" vs. \"Our proposal involves *both* institutional and public ownership, creating a system of checks and balances [similar to the BBC].\"\nOur Case Strength:\n- Our evidence is stronger. The WeWork example is an outlier. The BBC, while not perfect, provides a *direct* counter-example of a real organisation using both public and institutional input to stay accountable.\n- Direct comparison: We present a positive, working model. They present a cautionary tale failing to mention the alternative regulatory framework. Our mixed model creates accountability.\n- Superior reasoning: The BBC demonstrates a commitment to public service often lacking in purely private media.\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- They fail to address how purely private ownership *prevents* accountability to the public.\n- They have no solutions for hedge funds that prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability. They fail to account for stakeholders beyond shareholders. In particular, users of the platform.\nCrucial Impact:\n- This clash determines which ownership model is better suited to promoting ethical governance, platform stability, and user trust.\n- If broader ownership can indeed lead to accountability and ethical governance, as we maintain, it provides a strong justification for limiting individual shareholding.\n\n**KEY CLASH 3**\nQuote: \"Limiting individual shareholding restricts investment diversity and can stifle innovation within social media platforms\" vs. \"With a more diverse group of stakeholders the platform would be forced to consider diverse needs.\"\nOur Case Strength:\n- Our principle is stronger. Innovation driven by *only* large shareholders narrows the scope to a single viewpoint. It's short-sighted and can be unstable.\n- Direct comparison: Our proposal *forces* companies to consider the needs of more than just one person, creating *healthier*, more complete forms of innovation overall.\n- Superior reasoning: We have a proactive framework encouraging better innovation, whereas they cling to a system dependent on a few viewpoints.\nTheir Response Gaps:\n- They have failed to show the impact of how innovation can be *harmed* by a single monopolistic shareholder being in charge.\n- They don't account for \"innovation for whom\"? Innovation designed to benefit only the shareholder is not always progress for the public.\nCrucial Impact:\n- This clash centres on the impact of shareholding limits on investment diversity and innovation. If our policy can push innovative platforms in a positive direction, it's an argument that outweighs the potential loss of individual driven progress.\n- It also highlights whose needs and opinions we need to consider for progress. A solo shareholder, or the public good?\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\nPriority Analysis:\n- The most important clash is the first: reframing the debate away from a violation of \"free market principles\" and reframing it for the sake of protecting against monopolistic ideals. Without this, the other clashes have no weight.\n- The second most important point is whether broader ownership can lead to accountability. IWe demonstrate that it can by way of counterexample (BBC), it disproves the opposition and reinforces our arguments.\n- The final consideration is innovation: we need to prove our changes would create more positive change for social media in the long run.\n\nCase Proof:\n- Winning the first key point proves our case by establishing that limiting individual shareholding is necessary for the public good.\n- Winning the second key point demonstrates that broader ownership is a viable and desirable alternative to concentrated private control.\n- Winning the third key point argues that our framework actively encourages more positive innovation than the alternative.\n- Together, this demonstrates that limiting individual shareholding creates a more equitable, responsible, and sustainable digital public square, *specifically* because it safeguards democratic values, promotes ethical platform governance, and builds trust in the digital spaces where billions of information is exchanged.\n\nFinal Weighing:\n- Any losses from our side are in parts of the debate which are merely tertiary. Our wins prove that they have failed to realize is that free markets are only *useful* insofar as they help improve societal good; their arguments fail on that front.\n- We win because we protect our democratic process first, above the profits of individual shareholders.\n- Vote proposition.\n"

      "opening": "**ARGUMENT 1**\n\n**Core Claim:** Limiting individual shareholding to 15% voting rights undermines the principle of free market ownership and individual property rights.\n\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE\n\n**Support Details:**\n- **Explanation of Key Principle:** The free market operates on the basis of voluntary exchange and individual ownership. Property rights are foundational to economic freedom, allowing individuals to invest, profit, and influence corporate decisions proportionally to their ownership.\n- **Validity and Importance:** Protecting individual property rights ensures that investors have control over their investments and can make decisions based on their judgment and risk appetite. This fosters trust and encourages investment, which is vital for the growth and innovation of companies.\n- **Application to the Topic:** Imposing a cap on individual shareholding interferes with investors' rights to control their investments. It imposes an arbitrary limitation that does not account for the diverse strategies and contributions of individual shareholders.\n\n**Connection:** By restricting individual voting rights, the proposed limit infringes upon fundamental economic freedoms and property rights, destabilizing the trust investors place in the free market and discouraging personal investment in social media platforms.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\n\n**Core Claim:** Broader institutional and public ownership can lead to inefficiencies and lack of accountability in corporate governance.\n\n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE\n\n**Support Details:**\n- **Specific Examples with Dates/Numbers:** The case of WeWork in 2019 illustrates how institutional ownership can lead to poor governance. Despite significant investment from institutional shareholders, WeWork faced a failed IPO and governance crises, illustrating that institutional control does not guarantee effective management.\n- **Real World Cases and Outcomes:** Institutional ownership often prioritizes short-term gains over long-term sustainability. For instance, hedge funds controlling large shares may push for quarterly profits at the expense of long-term strategic planning, as seen in the activism of certain institutional investors in companies like Uber (2019).\n- **Clear Relevance to the Topic:** These examples demonstrate that broader institutional ownership does not inherently lead to better governance or accountability. Instead, it can result in conflicting interests and decision-making driven by profit motives rather than the platform's best interests.\n\n**Connection:** The evidence shows that increasing institutional and public ownership does not necessarily lead to more accountable or efficient governance. Instead, it can introduce conflicting interests and short-termism, which can harm the long-term stability and success of social media platforms.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\n\n**Core Claim:** Limiting individual shareholding restricts investment diversity and can stifle innovation within social media platforms.\n\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE\n\n**Support Details:**\n- **Explanation of Key Principle:** Diversified ownership encourages a variety of perspectives and ideas, fostering an environment where innovation can thrive. When individuals have the freedom to invest, they bring diverse insights and motivations that can drive creative solutions and advancements.\n- **Validity and Importance:** Innovation is often driven by diverse inputs and the freedom to experiment. Restricting ownership concentration can limit the influx of new ideas and reduce the competitive pressure that motivates companies to innovate.\n- **Application to the Topic:** By capping individual shareholding, the proposed limit can reduce the number of diverse investors, thereby limiting the range of ideas and financial support necessary for continuous innovation within social media platforms.\n\n**Connection:** Restricting individual shareholding diminishes the diversity of investment and thought, which is essential for fostering innovation and keeping social media platforms dynamic and competitive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n\n- **Unified Case:** The arguments collectively demonstrate that limiting individual shareholding infringes upon fundamental economic principles, leads to inefficient and potentially conflicting corporate governance, and restricts the diversity and innovation necessary for the growth of social media platforms.\n- **Proving the Side of the Motion:** These points establish that the proposed limitations not only undermine individual rights and market efficiency but also fail to deliver the intended benefits of broader institutional and public ownership.\n- **Real-World Impact and Importance:** Maintaining unrestricted individual shareholding ensures robust investment, fosters innovation, and upholds the principles of a free market, which are crucial for the sustained success and evolution of major social media platforms.\n- **Link Back to Key Themes/Principles:** The opposition's case is anchored in the defense of property rights, market efficiency, governance accountability, and innovation\u2014key themes that underscore the importance of allowing concentrated private control in social media platforms with extensive user bases.",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Concentrated ownership of social media platforms enables undue influence over public discourse and information accessibility, which harms democratic processes.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\n- **Identify specific flaws/gaps in their principle:** The proposition relies on the principle that concentrated ownership inherently leads to undue influence and harms democracy. However, this principle overlooks the mechanisms of corporate governance and regulatory frameworks that can mitigate such risks.\n- **Show why the principle doesn't prove their point:** Concentrated ownership does not automatically translate to harmful influence. Many large corporations operate under strict regulatory oversight, transparency requirements, and accountability measures that prevent the abuse of power.\n- **Provide analysis of why it's insufficient:** The principle assumes a direct causal relationship between ownership concentration and negative democratic impacts without considering the diversity of corporate governance models and the potential for institutional checks and balances to prevent misuse of power.\n\n**Impact:** Undermining the proposition's foundational principle weakens their entire argument. If concentrated ownership does not inherently harm democratic processes, the motivation to impose arbitrary shareholding limits loses validity, thereby preserving the integrity of free market ownership and individual property rights.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Broader institutional and public ownership fosters greater accountability and responsiveness to societal needs, promoting ethical platform governance.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence\n\n**Challenge:**\n- **Present stronger evidence that opposes their claim:** Institutional and public ownership do not guarantee accountability or ethical governance. The 2019 WeWork debacle showcases how significant institutional investment can lead to poor governance and strategic failures despite substantial resources.\n- **Show why your evidence is more relevant/compelling:** WeWork's case directly illustrates that institutional ownership can prioritize short-term financial gains over long-term sustainability, leading to governance crises and instability.\n- **Directly compare strength of competing evidence:** While the proposition cites the BBC and Mondragon Corporation as examples of successful public and cooperative ownership, these cases are exceptions rather than the rule. The prevalence of governance issues in institutional ownership scenarios presents a more substantial and widespread challenge.\n\n**Impact:** Demonstrating that broader institutional and public ownership can lead to inefficiencies and lack of accountability counters the proposition's claim of inherent benefits. This reveals that such ownership models may not deliver the promised ethical governance, weakening the rationale for limiting individual shareholding.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Limiting individual shareholding reduces the risk of arbitrary and capricious decision-making that undermines platform stability and user trust.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle\n\n**Challenge:**\n- **Present your competing principle/framework:** The principle of free market competition and diversified ownership encourages stability and trust through multiple stakeholders overseeing platform governance.\n- **Show why yours is superior for this debate:** Free market competition ensures that no single entity or small group can dictate platform policies, as diverse ownership leads to a balance of interests and prevents unilateral decision-making.\n- **Demonstrate better application to the topic:** By allowing diversified ownership, platforms benefit from a variety of perspectives and investments, which naturally curtails arbitrary decisions and promotes long-term stability through collective oversight.\n\n**Impact:** Reinforcing the principle of free market competition as a superior framework underscores that diversified ownership, rather than imposed limits, is more effective in ensuring platform stability and user trust. This challenges the necessity and efficacy of the proposed shareholding restrictions.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Potential Weak Points:** The proposition might argue that free market mechanisms alone are insufficient to prevent abuse of power.\n- **Areas Opponent May Attack:** They may claim that without shareholding limits, individual owners can still exert undue influence despite existing regulations.\n- **Counter-Arguments Awareness:** Acknowledge that while regulations are imperfect, enhancing governance structures is preferable to imposing strict ownership caps that may have unintended economic consequences.\n\n**Additional Support:**\n- **Reinforcing Evidence/Principles:** Cite successful free market examples where diversified ownership has maintained platform integrity without restrictive shareholding limits.\n- **Address Likely Opposition Responses:** Argue that enhancing transparency and regulatory oversight is a more balanced approach to safeguarding democracy and platform stability than limiting ownership.\n- **Strengthen Key Claims:** Emphasize the importance of protecting economic freedoms and the potential negative impact of ownership caps on investment diversity and innovation.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**\n- **Clear Comparison of Competing Arguments:** Highlight that the proposition's benefits are theoretical and not consistently supported by empirical evidence, whereas the opposition's stance on protecting free market principles is grounded in widely accepted economic theories.\n- **Show Why Your Responses Are Stronger:** Our rebuttals provide concrete evidence and logical reasoning that dismantle the proposition's claims, demonstrating that their proposed solution may not yield the desired outcomes.\n- **Link to Broader Debate Themes:** Connect the importance of economic freedom, property rights, and innovation to the overall health and progress of social media platforms, reinforcing the opposition's foundational principles.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**\n1. **Principle of Ownership and Economic Freedom:** Whether limiting shareholding is necessary to prevent undue influence or if free market mechanisms suffice.\n2. **Effectiveness of Ownership Models:** The actual impact of institutional and public ownership versus concentrated private ownership on governance and accountability.\n3. **Risks of Ownership Limits versus Diversified Ownership:** Comparing the potential stability and trust benefits against the stifling of investment diversity and innovation.\n\n**Why We Win:**\n- **Victory on Key Points:** Successfully challenged the proposition's foundational principles and provided compelling counter-evidence and alternative principles that better support the opposition's stance.\n- **Compare Strength of Competing Claims:** Demonstrated that the benefits of the proposition's proposals are either overstated or not universally applicable, while the opposition's arguments are broadly supported and align with fundamental economic and democratic principles.\n\n**Overall Impact:**\n- **Proving the Case:** By dismantling the proposition's key arguments and reinforcing the importance of free market ownership, property rights, and innovation, we establish that limiting individual shareholding is unnecessary and potentially harmful.\n- **Importance for Motion:** Maintaining unrestricted individual shareholding preserves economic freedoms, encourages diverse investments, and fosters innovation, which are essential for the sustained success and evolution of major social media platforms.\n\n---",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n---\n\n### **FRAMING**\n\n**Core Questions:**\n- **Fundamental Issues:** The debate centers on the balance between individual property rights and the public interest in the context of social media platform ownership. It questions whether limiting individual shareholding is necessary to protect democratic processes or if such limitations infringe upon economic freedoms and innovation.\n  \n- **Key Decisions:** The critical decision revolves around whether the potential risks of concentrated ownership\u2014such as undue influence and harm to democratic discourse\u2014outweigh the benefits of maintaining free market ownership and individual property rights.\n\n- **Evaluation Framework:** The debate should be evaluated based on the principles of economic freedom, property rights, corporate governance efficiency, and the capacity for innovation within social media platforms. Additionally, the real-world implications of ownership structures on platform stability and user trust must be considered.\n\n**Framing:**  \nThe proposition argues that limiting individual shareholding is essential to prevent undue influence and protect democratic discourse. However, the opposition contends that such limitations undermine fundamental economic principles, lead to inefficient governance, and stifle innovation. Our evaluation framework prioritizes economic freedoms, market efficiency, and the fostering of a diverse and innovative digital ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### **KEY CLASHES**\n\n#### **Clash 1: Principle of Ownership and Economic Freedom**\n\n- **Quote:**  \n  *Proposition:* \"Concentrated ownership of social media platforms enables undue influence over public discourse and information accessibility, which harms democratic processes.\"  \n  *Opposition:* \"Limiting individual shareholding to 15% voting rights undermines the principle of free market ownership and individual property rights.\"\n\n- **Our Case Strength:**  \n  - **Superior Principles:** We uphold the foundational economic principles of property rights and free market ownership, which are essential for economic growth and innovation.\n  - **Evidence Comparison:** While the proposition cites examples like Cambridge Analytica to highlight risks, we emphasize successful free market operations and regulatory frameworks that mitigate such risks without limiting ownership.\n  - **Reasoning:** Property rights incentivize investment and responsible management. Limiting ownership arbitrarily disrupts these incentives, potentially leading to reduced investment and platform stagnation.\n\n- **Their Response Gaps:**  \n  - **Flaws in Proposition's Principle:** The proposition overlooks existing regulatory mechanisms that prevent abuse of concentrated ownership, relying instead on a flawed premise that ownership concentration inherently harms democracy.\n  - **Unaddressed Issues:** They fail to demonstrate that regulatory frameworks are insufficient, making ownership limits an unnecessary and extreme measure.\n\n- **Crucial Impact:**  \n  - **Economic Freedom:** Restricting ownership imposes undue limitations on investors, deterring investment and innovation.\n  - **Market Efficiency:** Free market ownership ensures that platforms are responsive to user needs and competitive pressures, fostering a dynamic and efficient digital environment.\n\n#### **Clash 2: Effectiveness of Ownership Models on Governance**\n\n- **Quote:**  \n  *Proposition:* \"Broader institutional and public ownership fosters greater accountability and responsiveness to societal needs, promoting ethical platform governance.\"  \n  *Opposition:* \"Broader institutional and public ownership can lead to inefficiencies and lack of accountability in corporate governance.\"\n\n- **Our Case Strength:**  \n  - **Evidence Quality:** We provide concrete examples like WeWork (2019) to demonstrate that institutional ownership does not guarantee effective governance and can, in fact, lead to strategic failures.\n  - **Comparative Analysis:** Contrasting the proposition's selective examples (BBC, Mondragon) with broader instances of institutional governance failures illustrates that their evidence is not universally applicable.\n  - **Reasoning:** Institutional investors often prioritize short-term financial gains over long-term sustainability, leading to governance issues that harm platform stability.\n\n- **Their Response Gaps:**  \n  - **Selective Evidence:** The proposition's positive examples are exceptions, not the norm, and do not account for widespread governance challenges in institutional ownership.\n  - **Lack of Practical Solutions:** They do not provide a viable framework to ensure that institutional and public ownership would uniformly lead to better governance across all social media platforms.\n\n- **Crucial Impact:**  \n  - **Governance Efficiency:** Inefficient governance models can lead to platform instability, reduced user trust, and ultimately harm the platforms' success and societal impact.\n  - **Accountability:** Without guaranteed ethical governance, broader ownership may not fulfill the accountability promises made by the proposition.\n\n#### **Clash 3: Impact on Innovation and Investment Diversity**\n\n- **Quote:**  \n  *Proposition:* \"Limiting individual shareholding reduces the risk of arbitrary and capricious decision-making that undermines platform stability and user trust.\"  \n  *Opposition:* \"Limiting individual shareholding restricts investment diversity and can stifle innovation within social media platforms.\"\n\n- **Our Case Strength:**  \n  - **Principle Superiority:** Free market competition and diversified ownership inherently encourage stability and trust through a balanced oversight of platform governance.\n  - **Evidence Comparison:** Innovation thrives in environments where diverse perspectives and investments are encouraged, as seen in successful free market enterprises.\n  - **Reasoning:** Limiting ownership concentration prevents the monopolization of decision-making, fostering a collaborative environment that nurtures innovation and adapts to user needs.\n\n- **Their Response Gaps:**  \n  - **Overreliance on Single Actors:** The proposition assumes that individual owners are the primary drivers of arbitrary decision-making, neglecting the role of collective stakeholder input in a diversified ownership structure.\n  - **Unaddressed Innovation Drivers:** They fail to acknowledge that innovation is often driven by diverse teams and market competition, not solely by ownership structure.\n\n- **Crucial Impact:**  \n  - **Innovation Stifling:** Restricting ownership concentration limits the influx of diverse ideas and financial support necessary for continuous innovation.\n  - **Investment Diversity:** A diverse investor base ensures a variety of perspectives and motivations, enhancing the platform's ability to innovate and remain competitive.\n\n---\n\n### **VOTING ISSUES**\n\n#### **Priority Analysis**\n\n1. **Principle of Ownership and Economic Freedom:**  \n   - **Importance:** Fundamental to the debate, as it addresses the core conflict between individual property rights and public interest.\n   - **Priority:** Highest, as it underpins the legitimacy and feasibility of any ownership limitations.\n\n2. **Effectiveness of Ownership Models on Governance:**  \n   - **Importance:** Critical in determining whether broader ownership actually delivers on promises of accountability and ethical governance.\n   - **Priority:** Second, as it questions the practical benefits proposed by the proposition.\n\n3. **Impact on Innovation and Investment Diversity:**  \n   - **Importance:** Essential for the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of social media platforms.\n   - **Priority:** Third, though still highly significant, it follows naturally from the first two issues.\n\n#### **Case Proof**\n\n- **Logical Chain:**  \n  Free market ownership respects property rights \u2192 Encourages investment and innovation \u2192 Leads to efficient and competitive platforms \u2192 Ensures platform stability and user trust.\n\n- **Link to Motion:**  \n  By maintaining unrestricted individual shareholding, we preserve the motivations for investment and innovation, which are crucial for the growth and reliability of social media platforms. Limiting ownership disrupts this chain, resulting in less investment and slower innovation.\n\n#### **Final Weighing**\n\n- **Potential Loss Points:**  \n  Even if we concede minor governance inefficiencies, the overarching benefits of economic freedom and innovation outweigh these concerns.\n\n- **Overall Importance of Our Wins:**  \n  The defense of property rights, market efficiency, and innovation are paramount for the sustained success of social media platforms, outweighing the theoretical benefits of limiting individual ownership.\n\n- **Reason for Voting Our Side:**  \n  Upholding economic freedoms and fostering an environment conducive to innovation ensures that social media platforms remain dynamic, user-focused, and resilient against arbitrary decision-making. These benefits are critical for both the platforms and their vast user bases.\n\n---\n\n### **CONCLUSION**\n\n**Unified Case:**  \nThe opposition has demonstrated that limiting individual shareholding infringes upon essential economic freedoms, leads to inefficient and potentially conflicting corporate governance, and restricts the diversity and innovation necessary for thriving social media platforms. Our arguments collectively establish that the potential harms of such limitations significantly outweigh any purported benefits.\n\n**Proving the Side of the Motion:**  \nThe proposition's reliance on theoretical principles and selective examples fails to account for the robust mechanisms within free markets that prevent the abuse of concentrated ownership. Moreover, their proposed ownership models do not consistently deliver the governance and accountability they claim.\n\n**Real-World Impact and Importance:**  \nMaintaining unrestricted individual shareholding ensures robust investment, fosters continuous innovation, and upholds the principles of a free market. These factors are indispensable for the growth, adaptability, and sustained success of major social media platforms, which serve as critical infrastructures for global communication and information dissemination.\n\n**Link Back to Key Themes/Principles:**  \nOur stance is firmly anchored in the defense of property rights, market efficiency, governance accountability, and innovation. These themes are fundamental to the health and progression of social media platforms, ensuring that they remain responsive to user needs and resilient in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\n**Final Appeal:**  \nIn preserving individual property rights and fostering a free and competitive marketplace, we protect not only the economic integrity of social media platforms but also the diverse and dynamic exchange of ideas that underpins democratic societies. Therefore, the House should vote against limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms, ensuring that these critical digital spaces remain vibrant, innovative, and free from undue restrictions.\n\n---"

Direct Clash Resolution\n\n**Clash 1: Concentrated Ownership vs. Free Market Principles**\n- **Proposition:** Argues that concentrated ownership of social media platforms enables undue influence over public discourse, harming democratic processes. They cite examples like Cambridge Analytica and the control wielded by figures like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk.\n- **Opposition:** Claims that limiting individual shareholding undermines free market principles and individual property rights. They argue that property rights are foundational to economic freedom and that imposing a cap on shareholding is an arbitrary limitation.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s argument is strong in highlighting the potential dangers of concentrated ownership, particularly in the context of social media\u2019s influence on public discourse. However, the Opposition effectively counters by emphasizing the importance of property rights and the potential negative impact of such limits on investment and innovation. The Proposition\u2019s principle is valid but does not fully address the Opposition\u2019s point about the broader economic implications of limiting shareholding.\n- **Winner:** Opposition. The Opposition\u2019s argument about the foundational importance of property rights and the potential negative impact on investment and innovation is more compelling in this clash.\n\n**Clash 2: Broader Ownership Models and Governance**\n- **Proposition:** Argues that broader institutional and public ownership fosters greater accountability and responsiveness to societal needs, citing examples like the BBC and Mondragon Corporation.\n- **Opposition:** Counters that broader ownership can lead to inefficiencies and lack of accountability, using the example of WeWork\u2019s governance issues.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition provides strong examples of successful broader ownership models, but the Opposition effectively counters with the WeWork example, which highlights the potential pitfalls of institutional ownership. The Proposition\u2019s evidence is somewhat weakened by the Opposition\u2019s counter-example, which shows that broader ownership does not always lead to better governance.\n- **Winner:** Opposition. The Opposition\u2019s counter-example of WeWork effectively undermines the Proposition\u2019s claim that broader ownership inherently leads to better governance.\n\n**Clash 3: Impact on Innovation and Investment Diversity**\n- **Proposition:** Argues that limiting individual shareholding reduces the risk of arbitrary decision-making and encourages innovation through diverse stakeholder input.\n- **Opposition:** Claims that limiting individual shareholding restricts investment diversity and stifles innovation, arguing that innovation thrives in environments with diverse perspectives and investments.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s argument is valid in that it highlights the potential benefits of diverse stakeholder input. However, the Opposition\u2019s point about the importance of investment diversity and the potential stifling of innovation is more compelling. The Proposition does not provide sufficient evidence to counter the Opposition\u2019s claim that limiting shareholding could harm innovation.\n- **Winner:** Opposition. The Opposition\u2019s argument about the importance of investment diversity and the potential negative impact on innovation is more persuasive.\n\n#### 2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n- **Proposition\u2019s Core Arguments:** \n  1. Concentrated ownership harms democratic processes.\n  2. Broader ownership fosters accountability and ethical governance.\n  3. Limiting individual shareholding reduces arbitrary decision-making.\n- **Opposition\u2019s Core Arguments:**\n  1. Limiting shareholding undermines free market principles and property rights.\n  2. Broader ownership can lead to inefficiencies and lack of accountability.\n  3. Limiting shareholding restricts investment diversity and stifles innovation.\n\nThe Opposition\u2019s arguments are more directly tied to fundamental economic principles and have a broader impact on the debate. The Proposition\u2019s arguments, while valid, are more narrowly focused on the potential harms of concentrated ownership and do not fully address the economic implications of their proposed policy.\n\n#### 3. Consistency and Contradictions\n\n- **Proposition:** The Proposition\u2019s arguments are consistent and well-structured, but they rely heavily on specific examples (BBC, Mondragon) that the Opposition effectively counters.\n- **Opposition:** The Opposition\u2019s arguments are also consistent and well-supported, particularly in their emphasis on the importance of property rights and the potential negative impact of limiting shareholding on investment and innovation.\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides\u2019 arguments were presented in their strongest form.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The decision is based solely on the arguments made within the debate.\n- **Ignore Presentation:** Focused exclusively on the substance of the arguments.\n- **Framework Neutrality:** Maintained neutrality between the competing frameworks presented by both sides.\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\n- **Intervention:** No outside arguments or evidence were introduced.\n- **Shifting the Burden of Proof:** Both sides were held to the same standard of proof.\n- **Over-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** Both principled and practical arguments were evaluated based on their merits.\n- **Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** All arguments were addressed.\n- **Double-Counting:** No arguments were given credit multiple times.\n- **Assuming Causation from Correlation:** Claims of causation were scrutinized.\n- **Not Justifying Clash Decisions:** Each clash decision was explicitly justified.\n\n### IV.

      "logic": "Let me analyze this debate carefully and systematically, following the judging principles outlined. I'll walk through each section of the analysis:\n\n---\n\n### I. Core Judging Principles\n\n#### I.1 Direct Clash Resolution\n\nThere are three main clashes in this debate:\n\n**Clash 1: Free Market Principles vs. Public Interest Regulation**\n- Proposition: Concentrated ownership harms democracy; regulation is necessary to protect public discourse.\n- Opposition: Limiting shareholding undermines free market principles and individual property rights.\n- Analysis: The proposition successfully reframes the debate by arguing that free markets operate within regulatory frameworks to prevent harm to public goods. Their reasoning is stronger because they provide specific examples (e.g., environmental regulations) to justify reasonable restrictions on property rights. The opposition fails to address the unique risks of concentrated ownership in social media, weakening their argument.\n\n**Clash 2: Broader Ownership and Governance**\n- Proposition: Mixed ownership models (e.g., BBC, Mondragon) promote accountability and ethical governance.\n- Opposition: Broader ownership leads to inefficiencies and lacks accountability (e.g., WeWork).\n- Analysis: The proposition's evidence is more compelling. The BBC and Mondragon examples demonstrate successful models of accountability, while the opposition\u2019s WeWork example is an outlier. The proposition also counters the opposition\u2019s claim by arguing that their proposal includes checks and balances beyond purely institutional ownership.\n\n**Clash 3: Innovation and Investment Diversity**\n- Proposition: Limiting shareholding fosters healthier innovation by diversifying stakeholders.\n- Opposition: Limiting shareholding stifles innovation and restricts investment diversity.\n- Analysis: The proposition\u2019s reasoning is stronger. They argue that innovation driven by diverse stakeholders is more sustainable and beneficial to the public good, whereas the opposition fails to demonstrate how limiting shareholding inherently harms innovation.\n\n#### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n- The proposition\u2019s primary argument is that concentrated ownership threatens democratic discourse, which is the most significant issue in the debate. Their secondary argument on ethical governance is well-supported, and their tertiary argument on innovation is effectively defended.\n- The opposition\u2019s primary argument on free market principles is weaker because it fails to address the unique risks of social media platforms. Their secondary argument on governance efficiency is undercut by the proposition\u2019s stronger evidence.\n\n#### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions\n- The proposition maintains a consistent theme: protecting democracy and public interest. Their arguments are logically linked and free of contradictions.\n- The opposition\u2019s claim that broader ownership leads to inefficiency is contradicted by their failure to address the proposition\u2019s evidence of successful models (e.g., BBC).\n\n---\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n- Steelmanning: The opposition\u2019s arguments were fairly presented, but they did not adequately address the proposition\u2019s stronger reasoning.\n- Argument-Based Decision: The analysis is based solely on the arguments presented, with no outside knowledge introduced.\n- Framework Neutrality: Both sides presented valid frameworks, but the proposition\u2019s framework was more persuasive in this context.\n\n---\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to Avoid\n- No intervention, shifting of burden of proof, or double-counting occurred.\n- The proposition successfully avoided assuming causation from correlation by providing logical links between concentrated ownership and harm to democracy.\n\n---\n\n### IV. Decision Making\n- **Winner: Proposition**\n- **Confidence Level: 70**\n- **Key Factors:**\n  1. The proposition successfully reframed the debate, demonstrating that limiting shareholding is a necessary regulation to protect democracy.\n  2. Their evidence on mixed ownership models (BBC, Mondragon) was stronger and more relevant.\n  3. Their argument that diverse stakeholders foster healthier innovation was well-reasoned and countered the opposition\u2019s claims.\n\n---\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification\n- Proposition Opening Speech: Strong arguments on democratic harm, ethical governance, and decision-making risks, supported by clear evidence.\n- Opposition Opening Speech: Focused on free market principles and governance inefficiency but did not adequately address the proposition\u2019s core concerns.\n- Proposition Rebuttal: Effectively countered the opposition\u2019s arguments by providing stronger evidence and reasoning.\n- Opposition Rebuttal: Failed to undermine the proposition\u2019s key arguments and relied on weaker examples (e.g., WeWork).\n- Proposition Closing Speech: Clearly reframed the debate around protecting democracy and public interest, with strong evidence and reasoning.\n- Opposition Closing Speech: Maintained their stance on free market principles but did not address the proposition\u2019s stronger arguments effectively.\n\n---\n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>70</confidence>"

They argue that property rights are foundational to economic freedom and that imposing a cap on individual shareholding is an arbitrary limitation.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s argument is strong in highlighting the potential dangers of concentrated ownership, particularly in the context of social media\u2019s influence on public discourse. However, the Opposition effectively counters by emphasizing the importance of property rights and the potential negative impact of such limitations on investment and innovation. The Proposition\u2019s principle is valid but lacks a direct causal link between ownership concentration and harm to democracy, which the Opposition exploits by pointing out existing regulatory frameworks that mitigate such risks.\n- **Winner:** Opposition. The Opposition\u2019s defense of property rights and free market principles is more compelling, especially given the lack of direct evidence from the Proposition that ownership concentration inherently harms democracy.\n\n**Clash 2: Broader Ownership Models and Governance**\n- **Proposition:** Argues that broader institutional and public ownership fosters greater accountability and responsiveness to societal needs, citing examples like the BBC and Mondragon Corporation.\n- **Opposition:** Counters that broader ownership can lead to inefficiencies and lack of accountability, using the example of WeWork\u2019s governance failures.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s examples, particularly the BBC, are strong in demonstrating the potential benefits of broader ownership. However, the Opposition\u2019s counter-example of WeWork effectively challenges the universality of the Proposition\u2019s claims. The Proposition\u2019s argument is weakened by the lack of direct evidence that broader ownership would uniformly lead to better governance in social media platforms.\n- **Winner:** Opposition. The Opposition\u2019s evidence of governance failures in broader ownership models is more compelling, as it directly challenges the Proposition\u2019s claim that such models inherently lead to better governance.\n\n**Clash 3: Impact on Innovation and Investment Diversity**\n- **Proposition:** Argues that limiting individual shareholding reduces the risk of arbitrary decision-making and fosters innovation by considering diverse needs.\n- **Opposition:** Claims that limiting individual shareholding restricts investment diversity and stifles innovation, emphasizing the importance of free market competition and diversified ownership.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s argument is somewhat speculative, as it assumes that limiting individual shareholding will naturally lead to more diverse and innovative decision-making. The Opposition\u2019s emphasis on the importance of free market competition and diversified ownership is more grounded in economic principles and provides a stronger case for maintaining unrestricted individual shareholding.\n- **Winner:** Opposition. The Opposition\u2019s argument is more robust, as it directly links unrestricted ownership to innovation and investment diversity, which are critical for the growth and success of social media platforms.\n\n#### 2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n- **Proposition:** The core arguments revolve around the dangers of concentrated ownership, the benefits of broader ownership models, and the need to reduce arbitrary decision-making. While these arguments are valid, they are somewhat speculative and lack direct evidence to support their claims.\n- **Opposition:** The core arguments focus on the importance of property rights, the potential inefficiencies of broader ownership models, and the need to maintain investment diversity and innovation. These arguments are more grounded in economic principles and provide a stronger case against the Proposition\u2019s motion.\n\n#### 3. Consistency and Contradictions\n\n- **Proposition:** The arguments are consistent but rely heavily on theoretical principles and selective examples, which the Opposition effectively challenges.\n- **Opposition:** The arguments are consistent and well-supported by evidence, particularly in their critique of the Proposition\u2019s claims about broader ownership models.\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides\u2019 arguments were presented in their strongest form, with the Opposition effectively challenging the Proposition\u2019s claims.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The decision is based solely on the arguments made within the debate, without introducing outside knowledge or opinions.\n- **Ignore Presentation:** The analysis focuses exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections, disregarding presentation style.\n- **Framework Neutrality:** The debate was judged based on how well each side argued within their chosen framework, maintaining neutrality between competing frameworks.\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\n- **Intervention:** No outside arguments or evidence were introduced.\n- **Shifting the Burden of Proof:** Both sides were held to the same standard of proof.\n- **Over-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** Both principled and practical arguments were evaluated based on their logical validity and evidence.\n- **Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** All arguments were addressed, and their impact on the overall case was considered.\n- **Double-Counting:** No arguments were given credit multiple times.\n- **Assuming Causation from Correlation:** The Proposition\u2019s claims about the dangers of concentrated ownership were scrutinized for direct causal links.\n- **Not Justifying Clash Decisions:** Each clash decision was explicitly justified with reference to the analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals.\n\n### IV. Decision Making\n\n- **Winner:** Opposition\n- **Confidence Level:** 70 (Clear Victory)\n- **Key Factors:** \n  1. The Opposition\u2019s defense of property rights and free market principles was more compelling, especially given the lack of direct evidence from the Proposition that ownership concentration inherently harms democracy.\n  2. The Opposition\u2019s evidence of governance failures in broader ownership models effectively challenged the Proposition\u2019s claim that such models inherently lead to better governance.\n  3. The Opposition\u2019s emphasis on the importance of free market competition and diversified ownership provided a stronger case for maintaining unrestricted individual shareholding.\n- **Detailed Reasoning:** The Opposition\u2019s arguments were more grounded in economic principles and provided a stronger case against the Proposition\u2019s motion. The Proposition\u2019s arguments, while valid, were somewhat speculative and lacked direct evidence to support their claims. The Opposition effectively challenged the Proposition\u2019s claims about the dangers of concentrated ownership and the benefits of broader ownership models, leading to a clear victory.\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** The Proposition presents a strong case for limiting individual shareholding, emphasizing the dangers of concentrated ownership and the benefits of broader ownership models. However, their arguments are somewhat speculative and lack direct evidence.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** The Opposition effectively counters the Proposition\u2019s arguments by emphasizing the importance of property rights, the potential inefficiencies of broader ownership models, and the need to maintain investment diversity and innovation.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** The Proposition attempts to reframe the debate by arguing that limiting individual shareholding is a necessary regulation to protect the public interest. However, their arguments are still somewhat speculative and lack direct evidence.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** The Opposition effectively challenges the Proposition\u2019s claims about the dangers of concentrated ownership and the benefits of broader ownership models, providing strong counter-evidence and alternative principles.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** The Proposition reiterates their arguments, emphasizing the need to protect democratic values and promote ethical platform governance. However, their arguments remain somewhat speculative and lack direct evidence.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** The Opposition reinforces their arguments, emphasizing the importance of property rights, market efficiency, and innovation. Their arguments are well-supported by evidence and provide a strong case against the Proposition\u2019s motion.\n\n<winnerName>opposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>70</confidence>"

Their rebuttal further strengthens their position by contextualizing shareholding limits within regulated free markets, undermining the opposition's abstract principles without addressing the practical harms.\n\n### Clash 2: Effectiveness of Ownership Models on Governance\n\n**Proposition Statement:**\n\"Broader institutional and public ownership fosters greater accountability and responsiveness to societal needs, promoting ethical platform governance.\"\n\n**Opposition Statement:**\n\"Broader institutional and public ownership can lead to inefficiencies and lack of accountability in corporate governance.\"\n\n**Logical Validity:**\n- **Proposition:** Provides a logically coherent argument that diversified ownership enhances accountability, supported by examples like the BBC and Mondragon Corporation.\n- **Opposition:** Presents valid cases (e.g., WeWork) indicating that institutional ownership doesn't guarantee effective governance, suggesting inefficiencies.\n\n**Quality of Evidence:**\n- **Proposition:** Uses specific, credible examples (BBC, Mondragon) to showcase positive outcomes of broader ownership.\n- **Opposition:** Employs relevant real-world cases (WeWork) to highlight potential governance failures under institutional ownership.\n\n**Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n- **Proposition's Rebuttal:** Effectively counters the opposition's negative examples by arguing that WeWork is an outlier and presenting the BBC as a successful model of mixed ownership facilitating accountability.\n- **Opposition's Rebuttal:** Strengthens their position by emphasizing that broader ownership does not inherently solve governance issues, using WeWork to illustrate potential pitfalls.\n\n**Winner of Clash 2:** **Draw**\n\n**Justification:** Both sides present compelling evidence supporting their claims. The proposition provides successful examples of broader ownership fostering accountability, while the opposition counters with instances where institutional ownership led to inefficiencies. The exchanges reveal that the effectiveness of ownership models may be context-dependent, leading to a balanced outcome.\n\n### Clash 3: Impact on Innovation and Investment Diversity\n\n**Proposition Statement:**\n\"Limiting individual shareholding reduces the risk of arbitrary and capricious decision-making that undermines platform stability and user trust.\"\n\n**Opposition Statement:**\n\"Limiting individual shareholding restricts investment diversity and can stifle innovation within social media platforms.\"\n\n**Logical Validity:**\n- **Proposition:** Argues that diverse ownership mitigates risks of unilateral decision-making, fostering a stable and trustworthy platform environment.\n- **Opposition:** Claims that ownership limits reduce investment diversity, thereby hindering innovation due to lack of varied perspectives and financial support.\n\n**Quality of Evidence:**\n- **Proposition:** Uses logical reasoning to link diverse ownership with balanced decision-making, though lacks specific examples.\n- **Opposition:** Relies on the principle that diversification drives innovation, but does not provide concrete evidence to support the claim that shareholding limits directly stifle innovation.\n\n**Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n- **Proposition's Rebuttal:** Effectively challenges the notion that innovation relies solely on large shareholders by emphasizing diverse stakeholder input.\n- **Opposition's Rebuttal:** Attempts to uphold the importance of diversified ownership for innovation but lacks direct counter-evidence to the proposition's claims.\n\n**Winner of Clash 3:** **Proposition**\n\n**Justification:** The proposition logically articulates how diverse ownership can lead to more balanced decision-making, indirectly supporting innovation through varied stakeholder input. The opposition fails to provide specific evidence linking shareholding limits to reduced innovation, making the proposition's argument more robust in this clash.\n\n## I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n**Proposition Core Arguments:**\n1. **Concentrated ownership harms democracy** \u2013 Establishing the foundational threat to democratic processes.\n2. **Broader ownership fosters accountability** \u2013 Building on the first argument to show the benefits of their proposed solution.\n3. **Limiting shareholding reduces arbitrary decision-making** \u2013 Furthering the argument by linking ownership diversity to platform stability and trust.\n\n**Opposition Core Arguments:**\n1. **Limits undermine free market and property rights** \u2013 Arguing from fundamental economic principles.\n2. **Broader ownership leads to inefficiency and lack of accountability** \u2013 Challenging the effectiveness of the proposition's solution.\n3. **Limits restrict investment diversity and stifle innovation** \u2013 Highlighting potential negative outcomes of the proposal.\n\n**Logical Links:**\n- **Proposition:** Each argument builds upon the previous to establish a comprehensive case for limiting individual shareholding, emphasizing democratic integrity, accountability, and stability.\n- **Opposition:** Their arguments are grounded in defending economic freedoms and challenging the practical benefits of the proposition\u2019s solutions.\n\n**Impact:**\n- **Proposition\u2019s Arguments:** Directly threaten democratic values and platform integrity, which are of high consequence.\n- **Opposition\u2019s Arguments:** Focus on economic principles and potential inefficiencies, which have significant but slightly less immediate societal implications.\n\n**Relative Importance:**\n1. **Proposition\u2019s concentrated ownership harms democracy** vs. Opposition\u2019s limits on free market principles \u2013 Highest priority due to the fundamental nature of democracy vs. economic freedom.\n2. **Proposition\u2019s broader ownership fosters accountability** vs. Opposition\u2019s broader ownership leads to inefficiency \u2013 Second priority as governance directly affects platform integrity.\n3. **Proposition\u2019s shareholding limits reduce arbitrary decisions** vs. Opposition\u2019s limits stifle innovation \u2013 Third priority, important for long-term platform success.\n\n## I.3 Consistency and Contradictions\n\n**Proposition:**\n- **Internal Consistency:** Consistently argues that reducing individual ownership enhances democratic values, accountability, and stability.\n- **No contradictions detected.**\n- **Dropped Arguments:** None apparent; all claims are addressed in their speech.\n\n**Opposition:**\n- **Internal Consistency:** Maintains a consistent defense of free market principles and economic freedoms throughout.\n- **No contradictions detected.**\n- **Dropped Arguments:** The opposition does not appear to have significant dropped arguments; all major claims are addressed in their speeches.\n\n# II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides presented their strongest arguments. The opposition robustly defended economic freedoms, while the proposition thoroughly connected ownership structures to democratic integrity.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The decision is strictly based on the presented arguments without introducing external knowledge.\n- **Ignore Presentation:** Focused solely on argument substance, disregarding any rhetorical techniques.\n- **Framework Neutrality:** Assessed each side within their respective frameworks, evaluating based on the prioritized criteria.\n\n# III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\n- **No intervention:** No external arguments or evidence were introduced.\n- **No shifting burden of proof:** Both sides were held to the same standard in proving their claims.\n- **Balanced evaluation of arguments:** Neither side was over-relied upon real-world examples; principles were weighted appropriately.\n- **Addressed all arguments:** No family of arguments was ignored or double-counted.\n- **Causation vs. Correlation:** Demanded clear evidence of causation, particularly in the proposition's claims about concentrated ownership harming democracy.\n\n# IV. Decision Making\n\n**Winner:** **Proposition**\n\n**Confidence Level:** **75**\n\n**Explanation for Confidence Level:**\nThe proposition presented a more compelling case by directly linking ownership structures to democratic integrity and platform stability, effectively countering economic freedom arguments with practical implications for societal well-being. While the opposition provided strong arguments defending free market principles and questioning the practicality of the proposition's solutions, the proposition's core arguments had a more immediate and profound societal impact, leading to a clear but not overwhelming victory.\n\n**Key Factors:**\n1. **Clash 1 (Ownership and Democracy):** The proposition successfully demonstrated that concentrated ownership poses real threats to democratic processes, which are foundational to societal health.\n2. **Clash 3 (Innovation and Diversity):** The proposition effectively argued that diversified ownership fosters better decision-making and innovation, outweighing the opposition's more abstract principles.\n3. **Rebuttal Effectiveness:** The proposition's rebuttals adeptly challenged the opposition's claims, particularly in reframing shareholding limits within regulated free markets and providing counter-examples.\n\n**Detailed Reasoning:**\nThe proposition's arguments consistently highlighted the societal risks of concentrated ownership, using credible examples to substantiate claims about democratic harm and platform instability. Their rebuttals effectively neutralized the opposition's defenses of free market principles by demonstrating that regulated markets can mitigate monopolistic risks without entirely sacrificing economic freedoms. Although the opposition's arguments about maintaining economic efficiencies and innovation were valid, they lacked the same level of direct evidence connecting economic freedoms to tangible societal benefits in the context of social media governance. Consequently, the proposition's focus on protecting democratic values and ensuring platform accountability resonated more strongly within the debate's prioritized criteria.\n\n# V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** Addressed the dangers of concentrated ownership, the benefits of broader ownership, and the importance of limiting individual shareholding for democratic integrity.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** Challenged the proposition by defending free market ownership, arguing that broader ownership can lead to inefficiencies, and stating that limits stifle innovation.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** Responded to each opposition argument by critiquing the principles, countering evidence, and reinforcing the necessity of shareholding limits for democracy and accountability.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** Countered the proposition's claims by defending free market mechanisms, presenting counter-evidence against broader ownership benefits, and reinforcing the importance of economic freedoms.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** Reinforced the key clashes, emphasized the strengths of their arguments, and underscored the necessity of their proposal for protecting democratic values.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** Restated their defense of economic freedoms, challenged the feasibility of the proposition's solutions, and appealed to the importance of maintaining innovation and investment diversity.\n\n# IV.
