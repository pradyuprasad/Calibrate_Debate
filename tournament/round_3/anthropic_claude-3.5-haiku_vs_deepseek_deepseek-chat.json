    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**  \n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** A unified carbon trading market ensures fairness and equity in global emissions reduction efforts.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" (CBDR) is a cornerstone of international climate agreements. It recognizes that while all nations must contribute to emissions reduction, developed nations bear a greater responsibility due to their historical emissions and economic capacity.  \n- A unified carbon trading market operationalizes this principle by creating a level playing field where all G20 nations participate under the same rules, ensuring that no nation can free-ride or exploit loopholes in domestic systems.  \n- Domestic carbon tax systems, by contrast, allow nations to set their own rates and exemptions, leading to disparities in effort and undermining global equity.  \n**Connection:** A unified market ensures that all G20 nations contribute equitably to emissions reduction, aligning with the CBDR principle and preventing free-riding.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** A unified carbon trading market is more effective at reducing emissions than domestic carbon tax systems.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \n- The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the largest carbon market in the world, has reduced emissions by 35% since its inception in 2005, demonstrating the effectiveness of market-based mechanisms.  \n- In contrast, domestic carbon tax systems, such as Canada\u2019s, have faced challenges in achieving significant emissions reductions due to political resistance and inconsistent implementation across provinces.  \n- A unified market creates a larger pool of participants, increasing liquidity and efficiency in carbon credit trading, which drives down costs and incentivizes faster emissions reductions.  \n**Connection:** The success of the EU ETS and the limitations of domestic carbon taxes demonstrate that a unified market is a more effective tool for achieving global emissions reduction targets.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** A unified carbon trading market fosters international cooperation and trust in climate action.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \n- Climate change is a global problem that requires collective action. A unified market creates a shared framework for cooperation, fostering trust and accountability among G20 nations.  \n- Domestic carbon tax systems, by contrast, are often perceived as unilateral actions that can lead to trade disputes and accusations of \"carbon leakage,\" where industries relocate to countries with weaker climate policies.  \n- A unified market eliminates these tensions by ensuring that all nations are bound by the same rules and contribute to a common goal.  \n**Connection:** By fostering cooperation and trust, a unified market strengthens the global response to climate change and prevents the fragmentation of efforts.  \n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \n- Together, these arguments demonstrate that a unified carbon trading market is fairer, more effective, and more cooperative than domestic carbon tax systems.  \n- It ensures equity by operationalizing the CBDR principle, drives faster emissions reductions through market efficiency, and fosters international trust and collaboration.  \n- The real-world impact of this system is clear: it would accelerate global emissions reductions, prevent free-riding, and create a more unified and effective response to the climate crisis.  \n- By requiring G20 nations to participate in a unified market, we can achieve a more just and sustainable future for all.",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"A unified carbon trading market ensures fairness and equity in global emissions reduction efforts.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" (CBDR) is fundamentally undermined by a unified carbon trading market. A one-size-fits-all approach ignores the vast differences in economic capacity, historical emissions, and development needs among G20 nations.  \n- Developed nations, with their advanced economies and infrastructure, can easily adapt to a unified market, while developing nations may face severe economic strain, exacerbating global inequities rather than addressing them.  \n- Domestic carbon tax systems allow nations to tailor their policies to their specific economic and social contexts, ensuring that emissions reduction efforts are both fair and feasible.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it exposes the inherent inequity in the proposition's approach, showing that a unified market would disproportionately burden developing nations and fail to operationalize the CBDR principle effectively.  \n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"A unified carbon trading market is more effective at reducing emissions than domestic carbon tax systems.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The EU ETS, while successful in reducing emissions, has faced significant challenges, including price volatility, over-allocation of allowances, and carbon leakage, which undermine its effectiveness.  \n- Domestic carbon tax systems, such as Sweden\u2019s, have achieved substantial emissions reductions (25% since 1990) with greater stability and predictability.  \n- The proposition\u2019s claim that a unified market would be more effective is speculative and ignores the complexities and risks associated with scaling up the EU ETS model to a global level.  \n**Impact:** This critique is vital because it challenges the proposition\u2019s evidence base, showing that domestic carbon taxes can be equally, if not more, effective in reducing emissions without the risks associated with a unified market.  \n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"A unified carbon trading market fosters international cooperation and trust in climate action.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \n- A unified carbon trading market could actually erode trust and cooperation by imposing a rigid framework that may not be acceptable to all G20 nations, leading to resistance and non-compliance.  \n- Domestic carbon tax systems, when combined with international agreements and cooperation, can foster trust by allowing nations to implement policies that are tailored to their specific circumstances and capacities.  \n- The flexibility of domestic systems encourages voluntary participation and innovation, which are essential for building long-term international cooperation.  \n**Impact:** This point is critical because it demonstrates that the proposition\u2019s approach could undermine the very cooperation it seeks to foster, while domestic carbon tax systems offer a more flexible and inclusive path to international collaboration.  \n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition may argue that domestic carbon tax systems lack the global coordination needed to address climate change effectively.  \n- There is a risk that the opposition could highlight the success of the EU ETS as a model for global carbon trading.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Emphasize that international agreements, such as the Paris Accord, already provide a framework for global coordination without requiring a unified market.  \n- Highlight examples of successful domestic carbon tax systems, such as Sweden and Canada, to demonstrate that national policies can achieve significant emissions reductions.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our critique exposes the fundamental flaws in the proposition\u2019s approach, showing that a unified carbon trading market would be inequitable, risky, and potentially counterproductive.  \n- By advocating for domestic carbon tax systems, we offer a more flexible, fair, and effective solution that aligns with the principles of equity and international cooperation.  \n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The fairness and equity of a unified carbon trading market versus the flexibility and adaptability of domestic carbon tax systems.  \n- The effectiveness of a unified market in reducing emissions compared to the proven success of domestic carbon taxes.  \n- The impact on international cooperation and trust of a rigid, one-size-fits-all approach versus a flexible, inclusive framework.  \n**Why We Win:**  \n- We have shown that a unified carbon trading market would exacerbate global inequities, introduce significant risks, and potentially undermine international cooperation.  \n- Domestic carbon tax systems offer a more equitable, effective, and cooperative approach to addressing climate change, aligning with the principles of fairness and flexibility.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \n- Winning these key points demonstrates that the proposition\u2019s approach is fundamentally flawed and that domestic carbon tax systems provide a superior solution for achieving global emissions reduction targets.  \n- Our case highlights the importance of flexibility, equity, and cooperation in addressing the complex challenge of climate change, ensuring that all nations can contribute effectively and fairly.",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n- The fundamental issue in this debate is whether a unified carbon trading market or domestic carbon tax systems are more effective, equitable, and cooperative in addressing global climate change.  \n- The key decisions that matter are:  \n  1. Which system better operationalizes the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" (CBDR)?  \n  2. Which system is more effective at reducing emissions?  \n  3. Which system fosters greater international cooperation and trust?  \n**Frame how debate should be evaluated:**  \n- The debate should be evaluated based on which system better aligns with the principles of equity, effectiveness, and cooperation, as these are the core criteria for addressing the global challenge of climate change.  \n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Equity and Fairness**  \n**Quote:** \"A unified carbon trading market ensures fairness and equity in global emissions reduction efforts.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- We have shown that a unified market undermines the CBDR principle by imposing a one-size-fits-all approach that ignores the vast differences in economic capacity and historical emissions among G20 nations.  \n- Domestic carbon tax systems allow nations to tailor their policies to their specific contexts, ensuring that emissions reduction efforts are both fair and feasible.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition failed to address how a unified market would disproportionately burden developing nations, exacerbating global inequities rather than addressing them.  \n- They did not provide a convincing mechanism for how a unified market would operationalize the CBDR principle effectively.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Winning this clash is crucial because it demonstrates that the proposition\u2019s approach is fundamentally inequitable, while domestic carbon tax systems offer a fairer and more flexible solution.  \n\n**Clash 2: Effectiveness in Reducing Emissions**  \n**Quote:** \"A unified carbon trading market is more effective at reducing emissions than domestic carbon tax systems.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- We have critiqued the proposition\u2019s reliance on the EU ETS, highlighting its challenges, including price volatility, over-allocation of allowances, and carbon leakage.  \n- We provided evidence from successful domestic carbon tax systems, such as Sweden\u2019s, which have achieved substantial emissions reductions with greater stability and predictability.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition failed to address the significant risks and complexities associated with scaling up the EU ETS model to a global level.  \n- They did not provide evidence that a unified market would be more effective than domestic carbon taxes in reducing emissions.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Winning this clash is vital because it shows that domestic carbon taxes can be equally, if not more, effective in reducing emissions without the risks associated with a unified market.  \n\n**Clash 3: International Cooperation and Trust**  \n**Quote:** \"A unified carbon trading market fosters international cooperation and trust in climate action.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- We have argued that a unified market could erode trust and cooperation by imposing a rigid framework that may not be acceptable to all G20 nations, leading to resistance and non-compliance.  \n- Domestic carbon tax systems, when combined with international agreements, foster trust by allowing nations to implement policies tailored to their specific circumstances and capacities.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition failed to address how a unified market could lead to resistance and non-compliance among G20 nations.  \n- They did not provide evidence that a unified market would foster greater cooperation than domestic carbon tax systems.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Winning this clash is critical because it demonstrates that the proposition\u2019s approach could undermine the very cooperation it seeks to foster, while domestic carbon tax systems offer a more flexible and inclusive path to international collaboration.  \n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n- The most important clash is equity and fairness, as addressing climate change requires a system that is fair and just for all nations.  \n- Effectiveness in reducing emissions is also crucial, as the ultimate goal is to reduce global emissions.  \n- International cooperation and trust are essential for ensuring that all nations are committed to and engaged in climate action.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Winning the equity and fairness clash proves that domestic carbon tax systems are more aligned with the CBDR principle, ensuring that all nations can contribute fairly to emissions reduction.  \n- Winning the effectiveness clash proves that domestic carbon taxes can achieve significant emissions reductions without the risks associated with a unified market.  \n- Winning the cooperation clash proves that domestic carbon tax systems foster greater international trust and collaboration.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \n- Even if the proposition wins some minor points, the overall case for domestic carbon tax systems is stronger because they are more equitable, effective, and cooperative.  \n- The proposition\u2019s approach introduces significant risks and inequities that undermine its potential benefits.  \n- Domestic carbon tax systems offer a more flexible, fair, and effective solution for addressing the global challenge of climate change.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The opposition has demonstrated that domestic carbon tax systems are superior to a unified carbon trading market in terms of equity, effectiveness, and cooperation.  \n- We urge the judge to vote for the opposition, as our approach offers a more just, practical, and inclusive solution to the urgent challenge of global climate change."

      "logic": "**I. Core Judging Principles**\n\n**1. Direct Clash Resolution**\n\n**Clash 1: Economic Fairness and Equity**\n- **Proposition:** Argues that a unified carbon trading market ensures fairness by embedding the \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" (CBDR) principle, with graduated pricing scales and revenue recycling mechanisms for developing economies.\n- **Opposition:** Counters that a unified market undermines CBDR by imposing a one-size-fits-all approach, disproportionately burdening developing nations, and that domestic carbon tax systems allow for tailored policies that are fairer and more feasible.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s argument is logically sound and supported by specific mechanisms (graduated pricing, revenue recycling) that address equity concerns. The Opposition\u2019s critique, while valid in principle, lacks specific evidence to counter the Proposition\u2019s proposed mechanisms. The Proposition wins this clash due to the strength of their evidence and the directness of their response to equity concerns.\n\n**Clash 2: Implementation Effectiveness**\n- **Proposition:** Claims that a unified market is more effective, citing the EU ETS\u2019s 35% emissions reduction since 2005 and the elimination of national pricing inconsistencies.\n- **Opposition:** Critiques the EU ETS for price volatility, over-allocation, and carbon leakage, and highlights the success of domestic carbon tax systems like Sweden\u2019s.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s evidence from the EU ETS is strong and directly supports their claim of effectiveness. The Opposition\u2019s critique of the EU ETS is valid but does not provide sufficient evidence to undermine the Proposition\u2019s overall argument. The Proposition wins this clash due to the strength and specificity of their evidence.\n\n**Clash 3: Innovation Potential**\n- **Proposition:** Argues that a unified market drives innovation by creating consistent investment signals and a large-scale market for green technologies.\n- **Opposition:** Suggests that domestic systems drive more innovation but fails to provide specific evidence to support this claim.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s argument is supported by evidence from the EU ETS, which has driven significant green technology investment. The Opposition\u2019s claim lacks specific evidence and is therefore weaker. The Proposition wins this clash due to the strength of their evidence and the lack of counter-evidence from the Opposition.\n\n**2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact**\n\n- **Proposition\u2019s Core Arguments:** \n  1. Global Coordination Effectiveness: A unified market creates a more efficient and comprehensive approach to reducing emissions.\n  2. Economic Fairness: A unified market prevents economic disadvantages for countries with more stringent environmental regulations.\n  3. Technological Innovation: A unified market drives faster technological innovation in green technologies.\n- **Opposition\u2019s Core Arguments:**\n  1. Equity and Fairness: A unified market undermines the CBDR principle and disproportionately burdens developing nations.\n  2. Effectiveness: Domestic carbon tax systems are more effective at reducing emissions.\n  3. International Cooperation: A unified market could erode trust and cooperation among G20 nations.\n\n**Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s arguments are more directly linked to the motion and are supported by stronger evidence. The Opposition\u2019s arguments, while valid, are less directly supported by specific evidence and fail to fully counter the Proposition\u2019s claims.\n\n**3. Consistency and Contradictions**\n\n- **Proposition:** Consistent throughout the debate, with no internal contradictions. Their arguments and rebuttals align well, and they effectively address the Opposition\u2019s critiques.\n- **Opposition:** Generally consistent, but their critique of the EU ETS\u2019s effectiveness is somewhat undermined by their lack of specific evidence to counter the Proposition\u2019s claims.\n\n**II. Evaluation Requirements**\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides\u2019 arguments were presented in their strongest form.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The decision is based solely on the arguments made within the debate.\n- **Ignore Presentation:** Focused exclusively on the substance of the arguments.\n- **Framework Neutrality:** Maintained neutrality between the frameworks presented by both sides.\n\n**III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID**\n\n- **Intervention:** No outside arguments or evidence were introduced.\n- **Shifting the Burden of Proof:** Both sides were held to the same standard of proof.\n- **Over-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** All arguments were evaluated based on the criteria in Section I.\n- **Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** All dropped arguments were addressed.\n- **Double-Counting:** No arguments were given credit multiple times.\n- **Assuming Causation from Correlation:** Skepticism was maintained where causation was claimed without clear evidence.\n- **Not Justifying Clash Decisions:** Explicit justification was provided for every clash decision.\n\n**IV. Decision Making**\n\n- **Winner:** Proposition\n- **Confidence Level:** 75 (Clear Victory)\n- **Key Factors:** \n  1. The Proposition\u2019s strong evidence from the EU ETS demonstrating the effectiveness of a unified market.\n  2. The Proposition\u2019s specific mechanisms for ensuring economic fairness and equity, which the Opposition failed to effectively counter.\n  3. The Proposition\u2019s clear and consistent arguments linking their claims to the motion.\n\n**V. Line-by-Line Justification**\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** Strong opening with clear arguments supported by evidence from the EU ETS and specific mechanisms for economic fairness and innovation.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** Presented valid arguments but lacked specific evidence to counter the Proposition\u2019s claims.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** Effectively countered the Opposition\u2019s critiques with strong evidence and specific mechanisms.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** Critiqued the Proposition\u2019s arguments but failed to provide sufficient evidence to undermine them.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** Strong closing with clear synthesis of their arguments and effective weighing of key clashes.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** Reiterated their arguments but failed to provide sufficient evidence to counter the Proposition\u2019s claims.\n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>75</confidence>"

There were no significant shifts or concessions from either side.\n\n**I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact**\n\n- **Proposition's Core Arguments:**\n  1. **Global Coordination Effectiveness:** Unified market creates efficient, comprehensive emissions reduction.\n  2. **Economic Fairness and Global Equity:** Prevents economic disadvantages and ensures a level playing field.\n  3. **Technological Innovation Acceleration:** Drives faster innovation in green technologies.\n  \n  - **Logical Links:** Each core argument is supported by specific evidence or principles that directly connect to the central claim of the unified market's superiority.\n  - **Impact:** These arguments collectively suggest that a unified market is essential for meaningful global emissions reduction, economic fairness, and technological progress.\n  - **Importance:** All three are central, but **Global Coordination Effectiveness** is paramount as it underpins the feasibility of the entire proposition.\n\n- **Opposition's Core Arguments:**\n  1. **Equity and Fairness:** Unified market undermines CBDR, leading to global inequities.\n  2. **Effectiveness in Reducing Emissions:** Domestic systems are more stable and effective.\n  3. **International Cooperation and Trust:** Unified market may erode trust, whereas domestic systems foster cooperation.\n  \n  - **Logical Links:** Each core argument challenges the foundational aspects of the Proposition's claims, focusing on fairness, effectiveness, and cooperation.\n  - **Impact:** These arguments collectively argue that the unified market is flawed in its execution, potentially exacerbating inequities and being less effective.\n  - **Importance:** **Equity and Fairness** is the most critical as it challenges the moral foundation of the Proposition's approach.\n\n**I.3 Consistency and Contradictions**\n\n- **Proposition:**\n  - Maintains consistency in advocating for a unified market as a fair, effective, and innovative solution.\n  - No internal contradictions identified.\n  - No dropped arguments; all claims are addressed throughout opening, rebuttal, and closing speeches.\n  \n- **Opposition:**\n  - Consistently argues that a unified market undermines equity, effectiveness, and trust.\n  - No internal contradictions identified.\n  - No dropped arguments; all claims are systematically addressed across speeches.\n\n</I. Core Judging Principles>\n\n<II. Evaluation Requirements>\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides presented their strongest possible arguments. The Proposition effectively highlighted the benefits of a unified market, while the Opposition robustly challenged these points by emphasizing equity, effectiveness, and cooperation.\n  \n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The decision is based solely on the arguments presented within the debate text, without introducing external knowledge. Assumptions are analyzed based on their clarity and necessity within the arguments.\n  \n- **Ignore Presentation:** The analysis disregards any presentation styles, focusing purely on the substance of the arguments.\n  \n- **Framework Neutrality:** The debate does not present competing frameworks beyond each side's inherent approach. The evaluation maintains neutrality, assessing how well each side argues within their chosen framework based on the prioritized criteria.\n\n</II. Evaluation Requirements>\n\n<III. Common Judging Errors to Avoid>\n\n- **Intervention:** The analysis refrains from introducing any external arguments or evidence beyond what was presented in the debate.\n  \n- **Shifting the Burden of Proof:** Both sides are evaluated equally without imposing a disproportionate burden on either the Proposition or the Opposition.\n  \n- **Over-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** Both principled and practical arguments are assessed based on their relevance and strength, without giving automatic preference to one over the other.\n  \n- **Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** No arguments were dropped by either side; all were addressed comprehensively.\n  \n- **Double-Counting:** Each argument or evidence point is evaluated once, ensuring no duplication in credit.\n  \n- **Assuming Causation from Correlation:** Arguments that imply causation based on correlation are critically assessed, ensuring logical soundness.\n\n</III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID>\n\n<IV. Decision Making>\n\n- **Winner:** **Opposition**\n  \n- **Confidence Level:** **85**\n  \n  The Opposition presents a clear and compelling case that effectively challenges the Proposition's core claims. By undermining the principles of equity and fairness, highlighting the practical challenges of unified markets, and questioning the impact on international cooperation, the Opposition demonstrates stronger overall arguments. The evidence and principles employed by the Opposition notably weaken the Proposition's position, leading to a clear victory with a substantial margin.\n\n- **Key Factors:**\n  1. **Equity and Fairness Clash:** The Opposition's successful challenge to the Proposition's fairness argument, emphasizing adherence to the CBDR principle, was pivotal.\n  2. **Effectiveness in Reducing Emissions Clash:** The Opposition effectively highlighted the practical limitations of unified markets compared to domestic systems.\n  3. **International Cooperation Clash:** The potential erosion of trust through a rigid unified framework further solidified the Opposition's position.\n\n- **Detailed Reasoning:**\n  \n  The Opposition excelled in systematically dismantling the Proposition's arguments by focusing on foundational principles such as equity and fairness. By highlighting the limitations and risks associated with unified carbon trading markets, especially concerning the CBDR principle, the Opposition effectively countered the Proposition's claims of economic fairness and global coordination.
