    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "closing": "Ladies and gentlemen, as we arrive at the conclusion of this debate, let\u2019s revisit the core questions and the key clashes that lie at the heart of our argument: whether professors should engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their fields of expertise. \n\n**Key Clashes:**\n\n1. **The Responsibility of Professors:** Our original claim emphasized that professors have an ethical obligation to leverage their expertise to inform public discourse. The opposition argued that engaging in advocacy jeopardizes the objectivity of academia. However, we have demonstrated that objectivity does not equate to silence. Academic inquiry thrives on evidence-based opinions, and many fields demand that their experts speak out when their research is relevant to public wellbeing. Examples from public health during crises reinforce that advocacy can stem from a place of knowledge, not bias, thereby enriching public discourse rather than undermining it.\n\n2. **Enhancing the Relevance of Academia:** The opposition challenged our assertion that advocacy heightens the relevance of academic work by claiming it alienates students. However, we countered this with evidence that diverse viewpoints can be encouraged alongside advocacy, promoting a robust academic environment. Institutions can foster open dialogue even when professors are outspoken, showing that a commitment to inclusivity can run parallel to the act of advocacy.\n\n3. **Encouraging Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** While the opposition suggested that advocacy oversimplifies complex issues, we reinforced that interdisciplinary collaboration enriches academic discourse. Professors frequently work together across disciplines, ensuring that their advocacy ventures are well-rounded and thoughtful, reflecting the complexity of the challenges at hand.\n\n**Voting:**\n\nThe clashing points that matter most are those regarding the responsibility of professors and the enhancement of academia's relevance. Our arguments strengthen the case that advocacy is not only appropriate but also essential in applying academic knowledge to societal dilemmas. The opposition's fears around objectivity and alienation are mitigated by our emphasis on evidence and open dialogue, undermining any valid concerns they presented.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown compellingly why the engagement of professors in public advocacy contributes positively to society. It upholds the integrity of their expertise, fosters a more informed citizenry, and encourages a collaborative approach necessary for tackling today\u2019s pressing issues. \n\nTherefore, we affirm that this House believes professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their fields of expertise. Thank you."

      "closing": "### Final Speech: Why the Proposition Wins\n\n#### Framing\nThis debate ultimately comes down to one core question: **Should professors use their expertise to actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field?** The proposition argues that this engagement is not only beneficial but necessary for societal progress, while the opposition claims it risks undermining academic integrity and inclusivity. However, the proposition\u2019s case demonstrates that the benefits of advocacy far outweigh the risks, and the opposition\u2019s concerns are either overstated or addressable.\n\n#### Key Clashes\n1. **Objectivity vs. Advocacy**  \n   - **Opposition Claim:** Professors engaging in advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions.  \n   - **Proposition Response:** Objectivity is not about neutrality but about rigorous, evidence-based inquiry. Advocacy grounded in research, as seen in fields like public health, enhances credibility rather than diminishing it.  \n   - **Why We Win:** The opposition conflates advocacy with bias, but evidence-based advocacy aligns with the core principles of academia. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, public health experts advocated for mask mandates and vaccinations based on research, which was widely accepted as both objective and necessary. This reframes advocacy as an extension of academic responsibility, not a threat to it.  \n\n2. **Inclusivity and Alienation**  \n   - **Opposition Claim:** Public advocacy can alienate students and colleagues with differing views.  \n   - **Proposition Response:** Advocacy can coexist with inclusivity when professors model respectful dialogue and encourage diverse perspectives. Institutions like Harvard and Stanford demonstrate this balance effectively.  \n   - **Why We Win:** The opposition\u2019s evidence is incomplete and fails to account for the role of academic institutions in fostering constructive debate. Advocacy does not inherently exclude differing views; it can enrich discourse when handled responsibly.  \n\n3. **Expertise and Interdisciplinary Collaboration**  \n   - **Opposition Claim:** Professors may lack the expertise or mandate to engage in public advocacy on complex issues.  \n   - **Proposition Response:** Interdisciplinary collaboration ensures that advocacy is well-informed and balanced. For example, climate change advocacy involves scientists, economists, and policymakers working together.  \n   - **Why We Win:** The opposition\u2019s concern about expertise is mitigated by the collaborative nature of academia. Professors are not isolated experts; they work across disciplines to address multifaceted issues, ensuring that advocacy is both informed and effective.  \n\n#### Voting\nThe proposition wins this debate because we have successfully addressed the opposition\u2019s core concerns and demonstrated that the benefits of advocacy far outweigh the risks.  \n\n1. **Objectivity and Advocacy:** We reframed advocacy as evidence-based and aligned with academic principles, neutralizing the opposition\u2019s primary argument about credibility.  \n2. **Inclusivity and Alienation:** We showed that advocacy can coexist with inclusivity when handled responsibly, undermining the opposition\u2019s claim about alienation.  \n3. **Expertise and Collaboration:** We highlighted the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in ensuring that advocacy is well-informed and balanced, addressing the opposition\u2019s concern about expertise.  \n\nThese key clashes matter most because they directly address the opposition\u2019s foundational arguments. By winning these points, we prove that professors\u2019 engagement in public advocacy is not only justified but essential for leveraging academic expertise to address societal challenges. The benefits of informed, evidence-based advocacy\u2014such as fostering public awareness, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, and driving societal progress\u2014outweigh any potential risks.  \n\nIn conclusion, the proposition\u2019s case stands stronger because it aligns with the core mission of academia: to use knowledge for the betterment of society. We urge you to vote in favor of the motion."

      "logic": "I. Core Judging Principles\n\nI.1 Direct Clash Resolution\nThe debate revolves around three key clashes:\n1. The responsibility of professors to engage in public advocacy vs. the risk of undermining academic objectivity.\n2. The enhancement of academia's relevance through advocacy vs. the potential alienation of students and colleagues.\n3. The promotion of interdisciplinary collaboration through advocacy vs. the risk of oversimplifying complex issues.\n\nIn each clash, proposition effectively counters the opposition's arguments by reframing advocacy as an extension of academic responsibility, demonstrating that it can coexist with inclusivity, and highlighting the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in ensuring well-informed advocacy.\n\nI.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\nProposition's core arguments emphasize the ethical obligation of professors to engage in public advocacy, the enhancement of academia's relevance, and the promotion of interdisciplinary collaboration. These arguments are logically linked and supported by specific examples, such as public health advocacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The stated impacts include fostering public awareness, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, and driving societal progress.\n\nOpposition's core arguments focus on the risk of undermining academic objectivity, the potential alienation of students and colleagues, and the lack of expertise in complex social and political issues. While these arguments are valid, the proposition effectively counters them by reframing advocacy as evidence-based and aligned with academic principles, demonstrating that it can coexist with inclusivity, and highlighting the role of interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\nI.3 Consistency and Contradictions\nBoth sides maintain consistency in their arguments and rebuttals. Proposition effectively addresses the opposition's concerns without dropping any significant arguments. The opposition does not display any internal contradictions.\n\nII. Evaluation Requirements\nThe evaluation is based on the arguments made within the debate text, following the principles of direct clash resolution, argument hierarchy and impact, and consistency and contradictions. External knowledge or opinions are not introduced, and the decision is made based on the relative strength of the arguments presented.\n\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\nThe evaluation avoids common judging errors such as intervention, shifting the burden of proof, over-reliance on \"real-world\" arguments, ignoring dropped arguments, double-counting, assuming causation from correlation, and not justifying clash decisions.\n\nIV. Decision Making\nThe proposition wins the debate due to their effective reframing of advocacy as an extension of academic responsibility, demonstrating that it can coexist with inclusivity, and highlighting the role of interdisciplinary collaboration. The confidence level is 75, indicating a clear victory.\n\nKey Factors:\n1. The reframing of advocacy as evidence-based and aligned with academic principles, neutralizing the opposition's primary argument about credibility.\n2. The demonstration that advocacy can coexist with inclusivity when handled responsibly, undermining the opposition's claim about alienation.\n3. The highlighting of the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in ensuring that advocacy is well-informed and balanced, addressing the opposition's concern about expertise.\n\nThese factors are decisive because they directly address the opposition's foundational arguments and demonstrate that the benefits of advocacy far outweigh the risks.\n\nV. Line-by-Line Justification\n- Proposition Opening Speech: The proposition presents three core arguments emphasizing the ethical obligation of professors to engage in public advocacy, the enhancement of academia's relevance, and the promotion of interdisciplinary collaboration.\n- Opposition Opening Speech: The opposition raises concerns about the risk of undermining academic objectivity, the potential alienation of students and colleagues, and the lack of expertise in complex social and political issues.\n- Proposition Rebuttal: Proposition effectively counters the opposition's arguments by reframing advocacy as an extension of academic responsibility, demonstrating that it can coexist with inclusivity, and highlighting the role of interdisciplinary collaboration.\n- Opposition Rebuttal: The opposition attempts to maintain their stance but is effectively countered by the proposition's reframing and demonstrations.\n- Proposition Closing Speech: The proposition reiterates their core arguments and effectively counters the opposition's concerns, reinforcing their case for advocacy.\n- Opposition Closing Speech: The opposition attempts to summarize their case but is overshadowed by the proposition's strong rebuttals and reframing.\n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>75</confidence>"

      "logic": "### I. Core Judging Principles\n\n#### I.1 Direct Clash Resolution\n\n**Clash 1: Responsibility of Professors to Engage in Public Advocacy**\n- **Proposition:** Professors have a responsibility to leverage their expertise to inform public discourse on social and political issues. This is based on the principle of social responsibility, which dictates that individuals with specialized knowledge should contribute to societal betterment.\n- **Opposition:** Professors engaging in public advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions. Academic institutions are built on the principle of impartiality and the pursuit of truth without bias.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s argument is logically sound, emphasizing the ethical duty of professors to contribute to societal betterment. The Opposition\u2019s concern about objectivity is valid but conflates advocacy with bias. The Proposition effectively counters this by arguing that advocacy can be evidence-based, as seen in fields like public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Opposition\u2019s argument is weakened by this counter, as it fails to distinguish between partisan activism and evidence-based advocacy.\n- **Winner:** Proposition\n\n**Clash 2: Enhancing the Relevance of Academia**\n- **Proposition:** Active engagement enhances the relevance of academia to real-world issues. Studies show that when professors participate in public advocacy, they increase public awareness and interest in their fields.\n- **Opposition:** Public advocacy can alienate students and colleagues who hold differing views. Studies indicate that when professors express strong political opinions, it can create a chilling effect in classrooms.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s evidence is specific and directly relevant, showing the positive impact of advocacy on public awareness. The Opposition\u2019s evidence is also relevant but incomplete, as it does not account for the role of academic institutions in fostering respectful dialogue. The Proposition\u2019s rebuttal effectively counters the Opposition\u2019s claim by showing that advocacy can coexist with inclusivity, as demonstrated by institutions like Harvard and Stanford.\n- **Winner:** Proposition\n\n**Clash 3: Encouraging Interdisciplinary Collaboration**\n- **Proposition:** Public advocacy enhances the academic landscape by encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations. Engaging in public advocacy encourages professors to work across disciplines, integrating insights from various academic fields to address complex societal issues.\n- **Opposition:** Professors may lack the expertise or mandate to engage in public advocacy on complex social and political issues. Advocacy requires a broader understanding of societal dynamics, ethics, and policy implications, which may not fall within their expertise.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s argument is strong, emphasizing the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration. The Opposition\u2019s concern about expertise is mitigated by the Proposition\u2019s counter that interdisciplinary collaboration ensures that advocacy is well-informed and balanced, as seen in climate change advocacy. The Opposition\u2019s argument is weakened by this counter, as it does not fully address the collaborative nature of academia.\n- **Winner:** Proposition\n\n#### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n**Proposition\u2019s Core Arguments:**\n1. **Social Responsibility:** Professors have an ethical duty to contribute to societal betterment.\n2. **Relevance of Academia:** Public advocacy enhances the relevance of academia to real-world issues.\n3. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Public advocacy encourages interdisciplinary collaborations.\n\n**Opposition\u2019s Core Arguments:**\n1. **Objectivity:** Public advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions.\n2. **Inclusivity:** Public advocacy can alienate students and colleagues with differing views.\n3. **Expertise:** Professors may lack the expertise to engage in public advocacy on complex issues.\n\n**Impact Analysis:**\nThe Proposition\u2019s arguments are more central to resolving the motion, as they directly address the benefits of public advocacy. The Opposition\u2019s arguments, while valid, are more focused on potential risks, which the Proposition effectively counters. The Proposition\u2019s emphasis on evidence-based advocacy and interdisciplinary collaboration significantly strengthens their case.\n\n#### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions\n\n**Proposition:**\n- Consistent throughout the debate, with no internal contradictions.\n- Effectively counters the Opposition\u2019s arguments without dropping any significant points.\n\n**Opposition:**\n- Consistent in their concerns about objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise.\n- However, their arguments are weakened by the Proposition\u2019s effective rebuttals, particularly on the distinction between evidence-based advocacy and partisan activism.\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n**Steelmanning:** Both sides\u2019 arguments were presented in their strongest possible form. The Proposition\u2019s rebuttals were particularly effective in addressing the Opposition\u2019s concerns.\n\n**Argument-Based Decision:** The decision is based solely on the arguments made within the debate text. No outside knowledge or opinions were introduced.\n\n**Ignore Presentation:** The focus was exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\n\n**Framework Neutrality:** Both sides presented valid frameworks, and the debate was judged based on how well each side argued within their chosen framework.\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\n**Intervention:** No outside arguments or evidence were introduced.\n\n**Shifting the Burden of Proof:** Both sides were held to the same standard of proof.\n\n**Over-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** Both principled and practical arguments were evaluated based on the criteria in Section I.\n\n**Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** All dropped arguments were addressed as specified in I.3.\n\n**Double-Counting:** No arguments were given credit multiple times.\n\n**Assuming Causation from Correlation:** The Proposition\u2019s evidence was evaluated for direct relevance and specificity, with no assumptions of causation from correlation.\n\n**Not Justifying Clash Decisions:** Explicit justification was provided for every clash decision.\n\n### IV. Decision Making\n\n**Winner:** Proposition\n\n**Confidence Level:** 75 (Clear Victory)\n\n**Key Factors:**\n1. **Objectivity vs. Advocacy:** The Proposition effectively reframed advocacy as evidence-based, neutralizing the Opposition\u2019s primary concern about objectivity.\n2. **Inclusivity and Alienation:** The Proposition showed that advocacy can coexist with inclusivity, undermining the Opposition\u2019s claim about alienation.\n3. **Expertise and Collaboration:** The Proposition highlighted the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in ensuring that advocacy is well-informed and balanced, addressing the Opposition\u2019s concern about expertise.\n\n**Detailed Reasoning:**\nThe Proposition\u2019s case was stronger because they effectively addressed the Opposition\u2019s core concerns and demonstrated that the benefits of advocacy far outweigh the risks. The Proposition\u2019s emphasis on evidence-based advocacy and interdisciplinary collaboration significantly strengthened their case, while the Opposition\u2019s arguments were weakened by the Proposition\u2019s effective rebuttals. The key clashes on objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise were decisive in determining the outcome of the debate.\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n**Proposition Opening Speech:**\n- The Proposition\u2019s arguments on social responsibility, relevance of academia, and interdisciplinary collaboration were well-supported and logically connected.\n\n**Opposition Opening Speech:**\n- The Opposition\u2019s concerns about objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise were valid but were later effectively countered by the Proposition.\n\n**Proposition Rebuttal:**\n- The Proposition effectively countered the Opposition\u2019s concerns about objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise, reinforcing their case.\n\n**Opposition Rebuttal:**\n- The Opposition\u2019s rebuttals were less effective, as they did not fully address the Proposition\u2019s counters on evidence-based advocacy and interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n**Proposition Closing Speech:**\n- The Proposition\u2019s closing speech effectively summarized their case and reinforced their key arguments, emphasizing the benefits of public advocacy.\n\n**Opposition Closing Speech:**\n- The Opposition\u2019s closing speech reiterated their concerns but did not effectively counter the Proposition\u2019s arguments, particularly on evidence-based advocacy and interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>75</confidence>"

      "logic": "### I. Core Judging Principles\n\n#### 1. Direct Clash Resolution\n\n**Clash Point 1: Advocacy and Academic Objectivity**\n\n- **Proposition's Position**: \"Professors have a responsibility to leverage their expertise to inform public discourse on social and political issues.\" They argue that advocacy grounded in evidence can maintain objectivity, citing examples from public health experts during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- **Opposition's Position**: \"Professors engaging in public advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions.\" They assert that advocacy can lead to public skepticism about research integrity and tarnish the credibility of academic institutions.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- **Logic**: The Opposition's argument is logically consistent with the principle that academic institutions should be impartial. However, the Proposition successfully reframes the debate by arguing that objectivity is about rigorous, evidence-based inquiry, not abstention from public discourse. The Proposition's logic is strong here, as it distinguishes between evidence-based advocacy and partisan activism.\n- **Evidence**: The Proposition provides concrete examples, such as public health experts advocating for mask mandates during the pandemic, which is compelling evidence supporting the compatibility of objectivity and advocacy. The Opposition's argument relies on a general principle without providing strong counter-evidence to the examples given by the Proposition.\n- **Rebuttals**: The Proposition effectively challenges the Opposition's claim by citing real-world examples and redefining objectivity as evidence-based rather than neutral. The Opposition fails to counter this reframing with equally strong evidence or examples.\n\n**Clash Outcome**: Proposition wins this clash due to stronger evidence and more compelling logical reframing of objectivity.\n\n**Clash Point 2: Inclusivity and Alienation**\n\n- **Proposition's Position**: \"Active engagement enhances the relevance of academia to real-world issues.\" They argue that advocacy can coexist with inclusivity when professors model respectful dialogue and encourage diverse perspectives.\n- **Opposition's Position**: \"Public advocacy can alienate students and colleagues who hold differing views.\" They argue that strong political opinions can create a chilling effect, discouraging diverse viewpoints in classrooms and within academic departments.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- **Logic**: The Opposition's argument logically suggests that strong advocacy might suppress diverse viewpoints. However, the Proposition counters this by arguing that universities can foster both advocacy and inclusivity, as seen in institutions like Harvard and Stanford.\n- **Evidence**: The Proposition cites specific universities as examples of successful integration of advocacy and open discourse, which is a strong counter to the Opposition's evidence of alienation. The Opposition's studies on student alienation are relevant but weaker without addressing how these issues are mitigated.\n- **Rebuttals**: The Proposition effectively undermines the Opposition's evidence by pointing out the role of academic institutions in fostering respectful dialogue, which the Opposition fails to adequately counter.\n\n**Clash Outcome**: Proposition wins this clash due to stronger evidence and effective undermining of the Opposition's argument.\n\n**Clash Point 3: Expertise and Interdisciplinary Collaboration**\n\n- **Proposition's Position**: \"Public advocacy enhances the academic landscape by encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations.\" They argue that collaboration ensures that advocacy is well-informed and balanced.\n- **Opposition's Position**: \"Professors may lack the expertise or mandate to engage in public advocacy on complex social and political issues.\" They assert that advocacy may oversimplify complex issues and promote solutions that are not well-informed.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- **Logic**: The Opposition's argument is logically consistent with the principle that advocacy requires a broader understanding beyond one's specialization. However, the Proposition counters this by emphasizing that interdisciplinary collaboration mitigates the risk of oversimplification.\n- **Evidence**: The Proposition presents a strong case with examples like climate change advocacy, which involves collaboration across multiple fields. The Opposition's argument lacks this specific evidence and relies more on general principles.\n- **Rebuttals**: The Proposition successfully challenges the Opposition by showing that collaboration ensures well-rounded advocacy. The Opposition's response is weaker without specific examples or compelling counter-evidence.\n\n**Clash Outcome**: Proposition wins this clash due to stronger logic and evidence supporting interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n#### 2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n- **Proposition Core Arguments**:\n  - **Responsibility to Inform**: Strong principled argument supported by real-world examples.\n  - **Enhancing Relevance**: Supported by evidence of increased public awareness and engagement.\n  - **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Principle of collaboration effectively addressed with examples.\n\n- **Opposition Core Arguments**:\n  - **Objectivity Risk**: Undermined by Proposition's reframing and strong counter-evidence.\n  - **Inclusivity Risk**: Weakened by Proposition's examples of successful integration.\n  - **Expertise Limitation**: Mitigated by Proposition's emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The Proposition's core arguments are strongly interconnected. Their emphasis on evidence-based advocacy, inclusivity, and interdisciplinary collaboration logically supports their case.\n- The Opposition's arguments on objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise were challenged and counteracted by the Proposition's strong evidence and logical reframing.\n- The Proposition's argument hierarchy is more coherent and impactful, as their core arguments address both principled and practical considerations effectively.\n\n#### 3. Consistency and Contradictions\n\n- **Proposition**:\n  - No significant internal contradictions.\n  - Arguments are consistent in emphasizing the benefits of evidence-based advocacy while addressing risks.\n\n- **Opposition**:\n  - No significant internal contradictions.\n  - Arguments are consistent but less effective in countering the Proposition's strong evidence and logical reframing.\n\n- **Dropped Arguments**:\n  - The Proposition effectively addresses all Opposition arguments.\n  - The Opposition fails to counter the Proposition's reframing of objectivity and examples of successful advocacy integration, significantly weakening their case.\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning**: Both sides' arguments were presented in their strongest forms.\n- **Argument-Based Decision**: Decision is based solely on the provided debate text.\n- **Ignore Presentation**: Focused exclusively on argument substance and logic.\n- **Framework Neutrality**: Maintained neutrality between competing frameworks.\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\n- No errors found in intervention, burden of proof, reliance on real-world arguments, addressing dropped arguments, double-counting, assuming causation from correlation, or justifying clash decisions.\n\n### IV. Decision Making\n\n**Winner**: Proposition\n\n**Confidence Level**: 75\n\n**Key Factors**:\n- Reframing of objectivity as evidence-based inquiry.\n- Effective examples of successful integration of advocacy and inclusivity.\n- Strong emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration mitigating expertise concerns.\n\n**Detailed Reasoning**:\nThe Proposition wins the debate by effectively addressing and countering each of the Opposition's core arguments. They reframed objectivity as evidence-based inquiry, provided strong examples to counter claims of alienation, and highlighted the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in ensuring balanced advocacy. The Opposition's arguments were logically consistent but lacked the compelling evidence and examples provided by the Proposition. The confidence level of 75 reflects a clear victory due to the Proposition's strong evidence and logical consistency, though the debate includes some compelling points from the Opposition.\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech**: Arguments on responsibility, relevance, and collaboration set a strong foundation for the Proposition's case.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech**: Arguments on objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise provide a solid initial framework but are ultimately countered.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal**: Effectively challenges objectivity concerns and provides counter-evidence on inclusivity and collaboration.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal**: Attempts to counter with inclusivity examples but fails to address reframing of objectivity.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech**: Reiterates key points on responsibility, relevance, and collaboration with strong support.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech**: Recapitulates main points but lacks the compelling evidence and logical strength of the Proposition.\n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>  \n<confidence>75</confidence>"

The opposition struggled to address these reframings effectively, leading to a weakening of their overall case.\n\n#### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n- **Core Arguments of Proposition:**\n  1. **Responsibility of Professors:** Ethical obligation to inform public discourse.\n     - **Logical Links:** Strong connections between social responsibility and improving societal discourse.\n     - **Impact:** Enhances public awareness and informed policy-making.\n     - **Importance:** Central to the motion.\n  2. **Relevance of Academia:** Active engagement increases academic relevance.\n     - **Logical Links:** Effective in linking advocacy with increased public awareness.\n     - **Impact:** Leads to a more engaged and aware citizenry.\n     - **Importance:** Significant.\n  3. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Advocacy encourages collaboration.\n     - **Logical Links:** Clearly explains the benefit of interdisciplinary work.\n     - **Impact:** Promotes comprehensive and multifaceted solutions.\n     - **Importance:** Complements other core arguments.\n- **Core Arguments of Opposition:**\n  1. **Objectivity Risk:** Advocacy undermines perceived objectivity.\n     - **Logical Links:** Weak links due to failure to distinguish evidence-based advocacy.\n     - **Impact:** Erodes public trust.\n     - **Importance:** Central but weakened by proposition's response.\n  2. **Alienation:** Advocacy alienates dissenting views.\n     - **Logical Links:** Tenuous without addressing balanced advocacy.\n     - **Impact:** Hinders inclusive environments.\n     - **Importance:** Significant but mitigated by proposition's responses.\n  3. **Expertise Limits:** Professors lack necessary expertise for complex issues.\n     - **Logical Links:** Undermined by interdisciplinary collaboration evidence.\n     - **Impact:** Risks oversimplified advocacy.\n     - **Importance:** Important but weakened by proposition's collaboration argument.\n\n#### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions\n\n- **Proposition Consistency:** No significant internal contradictions; arguments consistently support each other.\n- **Opposition Consistency:** Some arguments undermined by the proposition's consistent counterpoints; lacked effective rebuttals to reframe their arguments.\n- **Dropped Arguments:** The proposition largely addressed all opposition arguments, thus weakening opposition's case.\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Arguments were charitably presented in their strongest forms.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** Decision solely based on presented arguments without introducing outside knowledge.\n- **Ignore Presentation:** Focus remained on logical and evidential analysis.\n- **Framework Neutrality:** Neutrality maintained between competing frameworks.\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\n- **Intervention:** No outside arguments or evidence introduced.\n- **Shifting the Burden of Proof:** Equal burden applied to both sides.\n- **Over-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** Balanced evaluation between principled and practical arguments.\n- **Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** All significant arguments were addressed.\n- **Double-Counting:** Arguments evaluated independently without overlap.\n- **Not Justifying Clash Decisions:** Clear and explicit justification for each clash decision was provided.\n\n### IV. Decision Making\n\n- **Winner:** The proposition effectively addressed all key clashes and demonstrated the benefits of public advocacy outweighing the risks.\n- **Confidence Level:** 85%\n  - **Explanation:** Proposition decisively reframed objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise concerns, leading to a clear victory.\n- **Key Factors:** \n  1. **Objectivity and Advocacy:** Reframing advocacy as evidence-based neutralized the opposition's main argument.\n  2. **Inclusivity vs. Alienation:** Successfully addressing inclusivity concerns with effective collaboration and dialogue.\n  3. **Expertise and Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Convincingly arguing that collaboration ensures well-rounded advocacy.\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** The proposition effectively established a responsibility of professors to inform public discourse, linking social responsibility with practical evidence.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** The opposition initially raised valid concerns about objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise but failed to address evidence-based advocacy effectively.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** Rebuttal directly challenged the opposition's concerns, particularly on maintaining objectivity and fostering inclusivity through balanced advocacy.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** The opposition attempted to counter but largely failed to counter the proposition's strongest arguments, particularly on interdisciplinary collaboration.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** The proposition successfully summarized key clashes and reiterated their core arguments, reinforcing their stance with reframed evidence.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** The opposition concluded by reiterating their initial concerns but struggled to address the proposition's reframed arguments effectively.\n\n```xml\n<winner>proposition</winner>\n<confidence>85</confidence>\n```"
