    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "closing": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and my worthy opponent, as we reach the conclusion of this debate, it is clear that our case for government transitioning its role in space from direct operation to regulation and oversight of private sector activities stands on solid ground.\n\n### Key Clashes\n\n**1. Safety and Accountability**\nOur argument emphasizes the necessity of government oversight to ensure safety and accountability in an increasingly crowded orbital environment. Although my opponent posits that private companies can self-regulate effectively, they fail to provide substantial evidence that reliance on private sector motivations always equates to enhanced safety. In contrast, we highlighted how effective regulatory frameworks can enforce compliance with international standards, reducing the risk of catastrophic failures, such as satellite collisions and environmental damage. Safety in space is not merely a matter of efficiency but a solemn responsibility given the potential consequences of failure. Hence, the principle of regulated safety outweighs the agility touted by private entities, which can only be relied upon in a framework that ultimately reinforces public accountability.\n\n**2. Technological Advancement**\nOn the matter of innovation, my opponent argues that excessive government regulation stifles progress. However, we countered this notion with substantial evidence: the success of private companies has largely been facilitated by the initial government investments that provided the foundation for their advancements. Companies like SpaceX owe their innovations to government contracts and support. Our case demonstrates that shifting to a regulatory role does not hinder innovation but instead creates a collaborative space that fosters technological advancements while ensuring that the resources are used equitably. By facilitating a robust regulatory framework, we encourage an environment where innovation can flourish responsibly rather than at the whims of unfettered corporate competition.\n\n**3. Equitable Distribution of Resources**\nMy opponent challenges the effectiveness of regulation in promoting equitable access in space. However, we stand strong on the principles of equity and collaboration presented in our arguments. We provided evidence that proper regulatory frameworks can empower smaller companies and diverse stakeholders, ensuring that all entities have a chance to contribute to and benefit from space exploration. The failure to recognize this equitable potential undermines the argument, as history shows how heavy-handed deregulation can lead to monopolistic practices and inequity. Our commitment to a fair distribution of opportunities is not an abstract principle; it is the linchpin for a collaborative approach to exploration that can yield diverse benefits, ultimately maximizing humanity's reach into space.\n\n### Voting\n\nIn conclusion, the crux of this debate hinges on the pivotal clashes surrounding safety, innovation, and equitable access. Our arguments consistently demonstrate that government regulation not only preserves safety and encourages technological progress but also creates an equitable environment ideal for widespread participation in space activities. While my opponent raises valid points about the complexities of regulation, they do not effectively mitigate our stronger evidence concerning the foundational importance of safety and shared responsibility.\n\nThe potential consequences of failing to implement adequate oversight are dire, while the benefits of our proposed transition are manifold and far-reaching. Therefore, we argue that prioritizing a regulated framework in space is not only beneficial but essential for a sustainable and collaborative future in space exploration.\n\nThank you."

Additionally, our challenges to the opposition's arguments are supported by evidence and principles that highlight the complexity and nuance of the issue, demonstrating that a more balanced approach is necessary.\n        To further support our key challenges, it is essential to consider the potential risks and unintended consequences of transitioning to a regulatory role. For example, the lack of accountability and potential for stagnation in the industry could be mitigated by implementing a hybrid model that balances government involvement with private sector innovation. Similarly, the risks of over-regulation could be addressed by establishing flexible and adaptive regulatory frameworks that prioritize safety and environmental standards while promoting competition and innovation.\n    </preemptiveDefense>\n    <weighing>\n        The most critical clash points in this debate are the potential risks and benefits of transitioning to a regulatory role, as well as the importance of balancing government involvement with private sector innovation. Our side wins the key points by highlighting the potential drawbacks of over-reliance on private companies, the limitations of regulatory frameworks, and the importance of considering the long-term benefits and returns on investment of government-led initiatives.\n        Ultimately, this debate affects the overall development of the space industry, as well as the potential for humanity to explore and utilize space in a responsible and sustainable manner. By carefully considering the potential consequences of transitioning to a regulatory role and adopting a more nuanced and balanced approach, governments can create an environment that fosters innovation, promotes safety and environmental standards, and ensures the long-term sustainability of the industry.\n    </weighing>\n</rebuttal>",

This dependence suggests that government involvement is still crucial for advancing space exploration and development, challenging the idea that private companies can single-handedly drive innovation and efficiency.\n        - **Quote:** \"Regulation and oversight by governments would ensure safety and environmental standards are met, while also promoting fair competition and preventing monopolies in the space industry.\"\n            - **Why we win this clash:** We presented a critique of the principle of government regulation, highlighting how overly stringent regulations can stifle innovation and create barriers to entry for new companies. This shows that the current approach to regulation may not be suitable for the rapidly evolving space industry, necessitating a more nuanced approach that balances safety and competition.\n        - **Quote:** \"The financial burden of direct space operation would be significantly alleviated for governments, allowing them to allocate resources more effectively and focus on other pressing national priorities.\"\n            - **Why we win this clash:** Our counter-evidence demonstrates that the long-term benefits and returns on investment of government-led initiatives, such as the Apollo program, can be significant. Moreover, the costs of regulating and overseeing private space activities may offset initial cost savings, challenging the assumption that transitioning to a regulatory role will automatically lead to significant financial benefits for governments.\n    </keyClashes>\n    <voting>\n        We win this debate by addressing the core questions effectively:\n        - **Innovation and Efficiency:** Our arguments highlight the importance of government involvement in driving innovation and efficiency, contrary to the notion that private companies alone can achieve these goals.\n        - **Safety and Regulation:** We demonstrate that while safety is paramount, the current regulatory framework may not be optimal for the space industry, suggesting a need for a more adaptive and nuanced approach.\n        - **Financial Burden:** By challenging the cost savings assumption, we show that the financial case for transitioning to a regulatory role is not as clear-cut as presented, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of the economic implications.\n        These points outweigh any potential benefits of transitioning to a purely regulatory role because they touch on the fundamental aspects of space exploration and development: innovation, safety, and financial sustainability. By winning these key points, we demonstrate that a balanced approach, combining government involvement with private sector innovation, is more likely to lead to a prosperous and sustainable space industry.\n    </voting>\n</finalSpeech>"

      "logic": "### I. Core Judging Principles\n\n#### I.1 Direct Clash Resolution\n\n**Clash 1: Safety and Accountability**\n- **Proposition:** Governments should transition to regulation to ensure safety and accountability in crowded orbital environments.\n  - **Support:** Effective regulatory frameworks maintain safety standards and prevent collisions.\n  - **Evidence:** Direct relevance to international treaties and best practices.\n- **Opposition:** Private companies can self-regulate effectively, often acting more swiftly than regulatory bodies.\n  - **Support:** Private entities prioritize safety to protect investments and reputations.\n  - **Evidence:** Examples of private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s argument is logically sound, emphasizing the necessity of government oversight for safety. The Opposition\u2019s counter-argument, while valid, lacks specific evidence that private companies can universally ensure safety without oversight. The Proposition wins this clash due to the stronger evidence and logical necessity of government regulation for safety.\n\n**Clash 2: Technological Advancement**\n- **Proposition:** Transitioning to a regulatory role enables governments to harness private sector innovation.\n  - **Support:** Success of companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin.\n  - **Evidence:** Specific examples of technological advancements and cost reductions.\n- **Opposition:** Excessive government regulation can stifle progress.\n  - **Support:** Historical delays in satellite technology and commercial spaceflight due to regulatory hurdles.\n  - **Evidence:** Examples of regulatory inefficiencies in the U.S.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition provides strong evidence of private sector innovation facilitated by government contracts. The Opposition\u2019s counter-evidence is valid but does not negate the Proposition\u2019s point that regulation can foster innovation. The Proposition wins this clash due to the stronger evidence of innovation under regulatory frameworks.\n\n**Clash 3: Equitable Distribution of Resources**\n- **Proposition:** Regulatory frameworks ensure equitable access to space resources.\n  - **Support:** Equitable access prevents monopolistic practices and promotes collaboration.\n  - **Evidence:** Principle of equitable access.\n- **Opposition:** Heavy-handed regulations can create barriers for smaller companies.\n  - **Support:** Historical evidence of regulatory structures leading to monopolistic practices.\n  - **Evidence:** Examples of larger corporations navigating regulations more efficiently.\n- **Analysis:** The Proposition\u2019s principle of equitable access is strong, but the Opposition\u2019s counter-evidence highlights potential flaws in regulatory frameworks. The Opposition wins this clash due to the stronger evidence of regulatory barriers.\n\n#### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n- **Proposition\u2019s Core Arguments:**\n  1. Safety and accountability through regulation.\n  2. Technological advancement via private sector innovation.\n  3. Equitable distribution of space resources.\n- **Opposition\u2019s Core Arguments:**\n  1. Private companies drive innovation and efficiency.\n  2. Government regulation can stifle innovation.\n  3. Financial burden alleviation through private sector involvement.\n\n**Impact Analysis:**\n- The Proposition\u2019s arguments are foundational to ensuring a safe, innovative, and equitable space sector.\n- The Opposition\u2019s arguments highlight potential risks of over-regulation and the importance of private sector involvement.\n\n#### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions\n\n- **Proposition:** Consistent in advocating for regulation to ensure safety, innovation, and equity.\n- **Opposition:** Consistent in arguing for private sector efficiency and innovation, with critiques of regulation.\n\n**Dropped Arguments:**\n- The Opposition did not directly address the Proposition\u2019s point on the necessity of government oversight for safety, which weakens their case.\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides\u2019 arguments were presented in their strongest form.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** Decision based solely on the arguments made within the debate.\n- **Ignore Presentation:** Focused exclusively on the substance of the arguments.\n- **Framework Neutrality:** Maintained neutrality between competing frameworks.\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\n- **Intervention:** Did not introduce own arguments or evidence.\n- **Shifting the Burden of Proof:** Both sides were held to the same standard.\n- **Over-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** Evaluated all arguments based on the criteria.\n- **Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** Addressed all dropped arguments.\n- **Double-Counting:** Did not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\n- **Assuming Causation from Correlation:** Demanded clear evidence of causal mechanisms.\n- **Not Justifying Clash Decisions:** Provided explicit justification for every clash decision.\n\n### IV. Decision Making\n\n**Winner:** Proposition\n\n**Confidence Level:** 70 (Clear Victory)\n\n**Key Factors:**\n1. **Safety and Accountability:** The Proposition\u2019s argument on the necessity of government oversight for safety was stronger and more directly supported by evidence.\n2. **Technological Advancement:** The Proposition\u2019s evidence of private sector innovation facilitated by government contracts was compelling.\n\n**Detailed Reasoning:**\nThe Proposition\u2019s arguments on safety and technological advancement were more robust and directly supported by evidence.
