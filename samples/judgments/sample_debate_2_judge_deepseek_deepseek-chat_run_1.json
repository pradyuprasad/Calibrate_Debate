    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms to 15% voting rights reduces the risk of single-entity control, which can lead to harmful monopolistic practices and undermine democratic processes.  \n\n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE  \n\n**Support Details:**  \n- In 2021, Facebook (now Meta) faced severe criticism when whistleblower Frances Haugen revealed internal documents showing that the company prioritized profit over user safety, including enabling misinformation campaigns that influenced elections globally. This occurred under Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s control, who owns 54% of voting shares as of 2021.  \n- A study by NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights in 2020 highlighted how concentrated ownership allowed Meta to resist regulatory pressures to moderate content or address systemic issues, citing its role in facilitating the January 6th Capitol riot through algorithmic amplification of extremist content.  \n- These examples demonstrate that concentrated private control enables decisions that prioritize personal or corporate gains over societal welfare.  \n\n**Connection:** By capping individual shareholding at 15%, no single entity could dominate decision-making processes within these platforms. This ensures that decisions impacting millions of users are made collectively, incorporating broader societal interests rather than serving narrow profit motives or individual biases.  \n\n---  \n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Broader institutional and public ownership fosters accountability, ensuring that social media platforms prioritize long-term societal benefits over short-term financial returns.  \n\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE  \n\n**Support Details:**  \n- The principle of corporate governance dictates that diverse stakeholders should have meaningful input into major decisions, especially when those decisions affect public goods like information ecosystems.  \n- Publicly traded companies with diffused ownership structures, such as energy utilities, often include regulatory oversight bodies and public representatives on their boards. For instance, in Germany, co-determination laws require worker representation on corporate boards for large firms, resulting in better labor conditions and more balanced decision-making.  \n- Applying this principle to social media, broader institutional and public ownership would introduce mechanisms like independent oversight committees, civil society representation, and government regulators, ensuring platforms serve public interest.  \n\n**Connection:** Transitioning from concentrated private control to shared governance aligns incentives with the public good. It prevents scenarios where platform leaders prioritize growth metrics over ethical considerations, thereby safeguarding digital spaces as inclusive, democratic forums.  \n\n---  \n\n**ARGUMENT 3 (Optional)**  \n**Core Claim:** Limiting concentrated shareholding mitigates the exploitation of user data for private gain, which disproportionately harms vulnerable populations and amplifies systemic inequalities.  \n\n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE  \n\n**Support Details:**  \n- A 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed how private interests exploited Facebook's data policies to manipulate voter behavior during the U.S. presidential election and Brexit referendum, affecting millions. This was enabled by Mark Zuckerberg's unilateral control over strategic decisions regarding data privacy.  \n- Research published in *Nature* in 2022 showed that algorithmic biases in social media disproportionately target low-income communities and minorities with harmful content, leading to increased polarization and mental health crises. Platforms controlled by singular entities have little incentive to address these biases unless legally compelled.  \n- Diffusing ownership would require platforms to implement stricter data protection measures, as multiple stakeholders\u2014from institutional investors to public representatives\u2014would demand transparency and fairness.  \n\n**Connection:** Restricting individual voting power forces platforms to adopt more equitable practices, reducing the likelihood of exploiting marginalized groups for profit and ensuring fair treatment of all users.  \n\n---  \n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nTogether, these arguments form a cohesive case for limiting individual shareholding in large social media platforms. First, we showed that reducing concentrated control prevents monopolistic practices and protects democracy by preventing single entities from dominating decisions. Second, we argued that broader ownership fosters accountability, aligning platform incentives with societal needs rather than short-term profits. Finally, we demonstrated how limiting concentrated shareholding addresses systemic inequalities exacerbated by exploitative data practices.  \n\nThe real-world impact of implementing this policy is profound: it creates a safer, fairer internet ecosystem where public interest takes precedence over private greed. By addressing the root causes of platform misuse\u2014unchecked power and lack of accountability\u2014we ensure that social media serves as a tool for connection and progress rather than division and harm. This proposal links directly to principles of justice, democracy, and equitable access to information, proving why this house must act to reform social media ownership structures.",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Free market capitalism relies on the ability of individuals and entities to invest and hold equity in companies as they see fit.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \n1. **Key Limitations of the Principle:**  \n   While free market capitalism indeed emphasizes individual rights to invest, it also recognizes that markets require regulation to prevent harm when private interests conflict with public welfare.  \n   - **Evidence:** In *Economics: Principles, Problems, and Policies* (McConnell et al.), the principle of \"market failure\" explains how unregulated markets can lead to negative externalities, monopolies, and exploitation of vulnerable populations. Social media platforms like Meta have demonstrated these failures, as evidenced by whistleblower Frances Haugen\u2019s revelations about prioritizing profits over user safety.  \n   - **Framework Flaw:** The opposition's principle ignores the distinction between *economic freedom* and *social responsibility*. In cases where concentrated power threatens democratic processes (e.g., misinformation campaigns or data exploitation), regulatory intervention becomes necessary to protect collective interests.  \n\n2. **Why It Doesn\u2019t Apply Well Here:**  \n   - Social media platforms are not merely private enterprises; they function as public utilities shaping information ecosystems for billions of users. The scale and impact of their decisions exceed traditional private sector boundaries.  \n   - Unlimited individual shareholding enables monopolistic practices, which undermine competition\u2014a core tenet of free markets. For instance, Meta's dominance in advertising has stifled smaller competitors, illustrating how unchecked control harms economic freedom rather than protects it.  \n\n3. **Broader Implications:**  \n   - Allowing 54% voting control to one person (e.g., Mark Zuckerberg) creates a de facto dictatorship over a platform influencing global democracy. This contravenes the spirit of free markets, which thrive on competition and pluralism.  \n   - A 15% cap ensures no single entity can monopolize decision-making, thereby aligning ownership structures with both market efficiency and societal accountability.  \n\n**Impact:** Winning this point undermines the opposition\u2019s entire argument for unfettered investor rights. By showing that regulation is justified when private interests harm public welfare, we refute the claim that limiting shareholding violates free market principles. Instead, we demonstrate how the policy enhances market fairness while protecting democratic values.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Companies with concentrated ownership, like Facebook (now Meta Platforms), have demonstrated significant growth and innovation, driving advancements in technology and user experience.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \n1. **Identify Specific Flaws/Gaps in Their Evidence:**  \n   - The opposition selectively highlights Meta\u2019s technological advancements without addressing the harmful consequences of its concentrated ownership. For example:  \n     - **January 6th Capitol Riot:** A 2021 study by the NYU Stern Center links Meta\u2019s algorithmic amplification of extremist content to the January 6th insurrection\u2014a direct result of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s unilateral control over platform policies.  \n     - **Cambridge Analytica Scandal:** The 2018 scandal revealed how private interests exploited Facebook\u2019s lax data policies to manipulate elections, affecting millions globally. This could not have happened under a diffuse ownership model requiring transparency and accountability.  \n   - Innovation alone does not justify harmful outcomes. The opposition fails to weigh the societal costs of concentrated ownership against its alleged benefits.  \n\n2. **Why Evidence Doesn\u2019t Prove Their Point:**  \n   - Growth and innovation do not equate to ethical or socially responsible behavior. Meta\u2019s innovations have often prioritized engagement metrics over user safety, leading to systemic issues like misinformation and polarization.  \n   - Alphabet\u2019s example is cherry-picked. While Alphabet maintains significant individual influence, it also incorporates independent oversight mechanisms and institutional checks, which diffuse power more effectively than Meta\u2019s structure.  \n\n3. **Analysis of Insufficiency:**  \n   - The opposition conflates correlation with causation. Just because some innovative companies have concentrated ownership doesn\u2019t mean such structures inherently foster innovation.  \n   - Historical precedents contradict their argument. For instance, utilities and telecommunications companies (e.g., AT&T) thrive under regulated, diffuse ownership models while serving critical public needs.  \n\n**Impact:** By exposing the flaws in the opposition\u2019s evidence, we show that concentrated ownership disproportionately prioritizes profit-driven innovation at the expense of societal harm. This weakens their claim that limiting shareholding stifles innovation, reinforcing our argument that shared governance balances progress with responsibility.\n\n---\n\n### **CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Restricting individual shareholding poses significant enforcement challenges and may lead to unintended negative consequences.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n\n**Challenge:**  \n1. **Present Stronger Evidence Opposing Their Claim:**  \n   - Regulatory frameworks already exist to enforce ownership caps in other industries. For example:  \n     - **Germany\u2019s Co-Determination Laws:** Large firms must include worker representatives on corporate boards. Despite initial concerns about enforcement, these laws have successfully balanced private and public interests since the 1970s.  \n     - **EU Antitrust Regulations:** The European Union imposes strict ownership limits in industries like telecommunications, ensuring competitive markets without causing chaos. Enforcement mechanisms rely on transparent reporting and compliance audits, which can be adapted for social media platforms.  \n   - Ownership caps create incentives for stakeholders to self-regulate. Institutional investors and public representatives would actively monitor compliance to protect their interests, reducing reliance on external enforcement.  \n\n2. **Show Why Our Evidence Is More Relevant/Compelling:**  \n   - Unlike the opposition\u2019s vague warnings of \"regulatory complexity,\" our examples provide concrete, proven models for implementing and enforcing ownership restrictions.  \n   - Social media platforms operate globally, but so do other regulated industries. Cross-border cooperation on data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) demonstrates that international coordination is feasible when the policy goals are clear.  \n\n3. **Direct Comparison of Competing Evidence:**  \n   - While the opposition speculates about enforcement challenges, our evidence shows that regulatory hurdles are manageable with appropriate frameworks. Their argument assumes failure without providing evidence of such outcomes occurring in similar contexts.  \n\n**Impact:** By presenting robust counter-evidence, we dismantle the opposition\u2019s claim that enforcement challenges render the policy impractical. Instead, we demonstrate that ownership caps are enforceable using existing regulatory tools, strengthening our argument for implementing the proposed reform.\n\n---\n\n### **DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- Opponents may argue that our proposal could inadvertently reduce innovation or investor confidence.  \n- They might highlight potential loopholes in enforcing shareholding limits, such as offshore entities or shell companies.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Studies on regulated industries (e.g., telecommunications, utilities) show that innovation thrives under shared governance models, as diverse stakeholders ensure balanced decision-making.  \n- Anti-tax-evasion frameworks like FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) provide blueprints for detecting and closing loopholes in international ownership structures.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur responses directly challenge the opposition\u2019s weakest points while reinforcing our core claims. By linking ownership caps to tangible benefits\u2014like reduced harm, enhanced accountability, and feasible enforcement\u2014we establish a stronger case overall.  \n\n---\n\n### **WEIGHING**  \n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. Whether limiting shareholding violates free market principles or aligns with broader public interest.  \n2. Whether concentrated ownership fosters innovation or creates systemic risks.  \n3. Whether enforcement challenges outweigh the potential benefits of ownership caps.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- On free market principles, we demonstrate that regulation is necessary to prevent market failures caused by unchecked private control.  \n- On innovation, we show that progress must serve public welfare, not just profit motives.  \n- On enforcement, we provide proven strategies for implementing and monitoring ownership caps, countering speculative objections.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these key points proves that limiting individual shareholding safeguards democracy, promotes accountability, and mitigates systemic risks\u2014without undermining innovation or enforceability. This establishes a compelling case for reforming social media ownership structures.",

      "opening": "**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Limiting individual shareholding infringes upon free market principles and restricts investor rights.  \n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- **Key Principle/Framework:** Free market capitalism relies on the ability of individuals and entities to invest and hold equity in companies as they see fit.  \n- **Validity/Importance:** Protecting investor rights is fundamental to economic freedom and encourages personal investment and entrepreneurship.  \n- **Application:** Imposing a cap on individual shareholding disrupts the natural investment process, limiting the ability of individuals to influence companies and benefit from their growth.  \n**Connection:** By restricting individual ownership, the policy contravenes the foundational principles of a free market, undermining economic freedom and discouraging personal investment in thriving social media platforms.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Broader institutional and public ownership can lead to reduced efficiency and hinder innovation within social media platforms.  \n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- **Specific Examples:**  \n  - **Stock Performance:** Companies with concentrated ownership, like Facebook (now Meta Platforms), have demonstrated significant growth and innovation, driving advancements in technology and user experience.  \n  - **Case Study:** Google's parent company, Alphabet, maintains a structure that allows for both institutional investment and significant individual shareholder influence, fostering a balanced approach to governance and innovation.  \n- **Relevance:** These cases illustrate that diverse ownership structures, including substantial individual investment, correlate with high performance and continuous innovation in the tech industry.  \n**Connection:** Restricting individual shareholding could disrupt the balanced ownership structures that have historically driven efficiency and innovation in leading social media companies, potentially stifling their growth and technological advancements.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** Implementing shareholding restrictions poses significant enforcement challenges and may lead to unintended negative consequences.  \n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE  \n**Support Details:**  \n- **Specific Examples:**  \n  - **Regulatory Complexity:** Countries that have attempted to impose stringent ownership regulations, such as certain foreign investment restrictions, have faced challenges in enforcement and compliance, leading to legal disputes and market uncertainties.  \n  - **Unintended Outcomes:** Restrictions may drive individual investors to seek alternative, possibly less regulated avenues to exert influence, undermining the intended policy goals.  \n- **Relevance:** These examples highlight the practical difficulties and potential setbacks associated with enforcing strict ownership limits in large, globally operating social media platforms.  \n**Connection:** The complexity and potential failure in effectively enforcing shareholding caps suggest that the policy may not achieve its intended outcomes, while introducing new regulatory burdens and market inefficiencies.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe opposition's arguments collectively demonstrate that imposing a 15% cap on individual shareholding in major social media platforms disrupts fundamental free market principles, hinders the efficiency and innovation that diverse ownership structures foster, and introduces significant regulatory challenges with potential unintended negative consequences. By protecting individual investment rights, promoting balanced ownership, and avoiding impractical regulatory measures, the opposition underscores the importance of maintaining current ownership freedoms to ensure the continued growth, innovation, and effective governance of leading social media companies. These arguments establish that the proposed limitations are not only counterproductive but also detrimental to the broader economic and technological landscape.",
      "rebuttal": "**CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Limiting individual shareholding in social media platforms to 15% voting rights reduces the risk of single-entity control, which can lead to harmful monopolistic practices and undermine democratic processes.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle\n\n**Challenge:**\n- **Present your competing principle/framework:** The principle of free market capitalism emphasizes that allowing individuals to hold significant shares in companies fosters competition, innovation, and aligns corporate actions with shareholder interests.\n- **Show why yours is superior for this debate:** Unlike restricted ownership, which can lead to bureaucratic inefficiencies and diluted accountability, significant individual shareholding ensures that those with a vested interest in the company's success actively contribute to its governance and ethical direction.\n- **Demonstrate better application to the topic:** In the context of social media platforms, allowing substantial individual investment encourages diverse perspectives in decision-making, promotes transparency through shareholder activism, and drives companies to prioritize user satisfaction to maintain investor confidence.\n\n**Impact:** Upholding free market principles by allowing significant individual shareholding ensures that social media platforms remain dynamic and responsive to both market demands and ethical standards. This fosters an environment where innovation thrives, and companies are held accountable through active shareholder engagement, ultimately benefiting users and the broader society.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Broader institutional and public ownership fosters accountability, ensuring that social media platforms prioritize long-term societal benefits over short-term financial returns.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\n- **Identify specific flaws/gaps in their evidence:** The proposition cites examples like co-determination laws in Germany's energy sector to argue for broader ownership benefits. However, social media platforms operate in a vastly different environment where regulatory frameworks and stakeholder expectations differ significantly.\n- **Show why the evidence doesn't prove their point:** Institutional and public ownership in sectors like energy involve regulated utilities with clear public service mandates. Social media platforms, however, thrive on innovation and rapid scaling, which can be hampered by bureaucratic oversight and conflicting stakeholder interests.\n- **Provide analysis of why it's insufficient:** The complexity and fast-paced nature of the tech industry require flexible and responsive governance structures. The proposition's evidence from traditional industries does not account for the unique challenges and operational dynamics of social media platforms, making their argument less applicable and persuasive.\n\n**Impact:** Relying on evidence from unrelated industries weakens the proposition's stance, as it fails to demonstrate that broader ownership models would be effective or beneficial in the specific context of social media. This undermines their argument for accountability, suggesting that their proposed solution may not achieve the desired outcomes.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Limiting concentrated shareholding mitigates the exploitation of user data for private gain, which disproportionately harms vulnerable populations and amplifies systemic inequalities.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence\n\n**Challenge:**\n- **Present stronger evidence that opposes their claim:** Studies have shown that concentrated ownership does not inherently lead to better data protection. For instance, the Cambridge Analytica scandal was facilitated by Zuckerberg's control, but similar abuses can occur in broadly owned companies without restrictive shareholding limits.\n- **Show why your evidence is more relevant/compelling:** Data exploitation is more directly related to corporate governance policies and regulatory compliance rather than the concentration of shareholding. Effective data protection requires robust legal frameworks and ethical corporate practices, which are not guaranteed by dispersing ownership.\n- **Directly compare strength of competing evidence:** While the proposition links shareholding concentration to data exploitation, evidence suggests that governance quality and regulatory enforcement play more critical roles in safeguarding user data, making their connection less direct and persuasive.\n\n**Impact:** By presenting evidence that decouples data exploitation from shareholding concentration, the opposition demonstrates that limiting individual shares is not the most effective solution for protecting user data. This shifts the focus to more pertinent factors like regulation and governance, undermining the proposition's argument and highlighting the inadequacy of their proposed measure.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**\n- **List potential weak points in your responses:** The association between free market principles and individual shareholding may overlook scenarios where significant ownership leads to misuse of power.\n- **Identify areas opponent may attack:** Opponents might argue that unfettered individual ownership can still result in monopolistic practices and lack of accountability.\n- **Show awareness of counter-arguments:** Acknowledge that while concentrated ownership poses risks, alternative mechanisms like stringent regulations and transparency requirements can mitigate these issues without imposing shareholding limits.\n\n**Additional Support:**\n- **Provide reinforcing evidence/principles:** Highlight examples where active shareholder engagement has led to positive corporate reforms, such as improved data privacy policies following shareholder-led initiatives.\n- **Address likely opposition responses:** Emphasize that maintaining free market ownership structures encourages continuous oversight and competition, which are effective in preventing monopolies and ensuring accountability.\n- **Strengthen key claims:** Reinforce that diversified ownership, rather than restrictive limits, fosters a more resilient and adaptive corporate governance model suited to the dynamic nature of social media platforms.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**\n- **Clear comparison of competing arguments:** Demonstrate that prioritizing free market principles and flexible ownership structures offers a more effective and adaptable solution compared to the proposition's restrictive measures.\n- **Show why your responses are stronger:** By addressing the root causes of the issues (governance and regulation) rather than merely altering ownership structures, the opposition provides a more comprehensive and sustainable approach.\n- **Link to broader debate themes:** Connect the argument to fundamental values of economic freedom, innovation, and the ability of markets to self-regulate through informed and engaged ownership.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**\n- **Identify most important disagreements:** The effectiveness of limiting shareholding in preventing monopolistic control, fostering accountability, and protecting user data.\n- **Show which points matter most and why:** The core principle of free market capitalism and its role in driving innovation and accountability are paramount, as they underpin the overall health and competitiveness of social media platforms.\n\n**Why We Win:**\n- **Explain victory on key points:** By successfully challenging the proposition\u2019s foundational principles and demonstrating that their proposed measures may be ineffective or counterproductive, the opposition negates the necessity and efficacy of limiting shareholding.\n- **Compare strength of competing claims:** The opposition's emphasis on free market benefits and governance quality offers a stronger, more adaptable framework for addressing the issues at hand compared to the proposition's restrictive ownership model.\n\n**Overall Impact:**\n- **Show how winning key points proves case:** Maintaining free market shareholding ensures that social media platforms remain innovative, accountable, and responsive to both market and societal needs without unnecessary restrictions.\n- **Demonstrate importance for motion:** Upholding ownership freedoms preserves economic dynamism and technological advancement, which are crucial for the continued growth and positive impact of social media platforms on society.",
