    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "closing": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, as we reach the conclusion of this debate, let us underline why the proposition clearly emerges victorious.\n\n**Key Clash One: Academic Enrichment through Advocacy**\nOur first clash centers on whether professors engaging in public advocacy enriches the academic community. The opposition claims that advocacy compromises objectivity. However, this assertion fails to recognize that many academic disciplines intersect deeply with social and political issues. For instance, in fields like climate science, engaging in public discourse is not merely an option but a responsibility. Professors can maintain objectivity while informing the public and informing policy. Our evidence shows that this engagement enriches public discourse, offering complex insights that contribute to societal understanding. The opposition's stance weakens when viewed through this lens of responsibility, which enhances the argument that professors should actively participate in advocacy.\n\n**Key Clash Two: Diversity of Viewpoints**\nSecondly, we discussed the diversity of viewpoints within academia. The opposition posits that advocacy could stifle minority perspectives due to the pressures of conformity. Yet, experiences from universities implementing public engagement initiatives demonstrate that such efforts can amplify a range of academic voices, enriching discussions rather than constraining them. Engaging professors in public debate leads to the emergence of diverse perspectives across contentious issues. This serves as a critical rebuttal to the opposition's claim, reinforcing that public advocacy not only maintains but can enhance the diversity of thought in academia.\n\n**Key Clash Three: Recognition of Skills**\nFinally, the opposition points to the potential lack of communication skills among professors as a reason against engagement in public advocacy. We acknowledge that not every professor may feel inclined to take on a public role. However, instead of viewing this as a deterrent, we argue for an institutional responsibility to support and equip those willing to engage. Academic institutions can offer training and resources, creating an environment where professors feel capable and empowered to participate in public discussions. This refocusing aligns with the necessity for academia to adapt to society\u2019s evolving expectations, emphasizing the importance of public advocacy as part of a professor's academic responsibility.\n\n**Summation of Impact**\nWinning in these critical areas demonstrates that the proactive involvement of professors in public advocacy is essential. It bolsters academic integrity by enhancing public discourse and informs policy decisions through expert insight. Furthermore, encouraging advocacy fosters a richer academic environment that values diversity and responsibility. \n\nWhile the opposition raised concerns about potential drawbacks, the long-term benefits of professors engaging in public advocacy substantially outweigh these issues. The case for professors as active public advocates is not merely beneficial; it is necessary for fostering informed citizenry, shaping policy, and upholding the societal role of the academic community.\n\nIn conclusion, we affirm that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise. Thank you."

When professors engage in public advocacy, they may be seen as taking a political stance, which could undermine their credibility and the credibility of their research.

For example, a survey by the American Association of University Professors found that a significant number of professors reported feeling hesitant to express their opinions on certain topics due to fear of backlash or repercussions. This lack of diversity in viewpoints can stifle academic debate and hinder the pursuit of knowledge.\n        </supportDetails>\n        <connection>\n            This evidence supports the claim because if professors are expected to advocate for specific social and political issues, it can create an environment where certain viewpoints are favored over others.

For instance, a professor of mathematics may be an expert in their field but not necessarily comfortable speaking to the media or the general public about their research.

Rather than expecting all professors to engage in public advocacy, we should encourage and support those who are inclined and skilled in this area to take on such roles, while allowing others to focus on their research and teaching.\n        </connection>\n    </argument3>\n    <synthesis>\n        In conclusion, the arguments presented demonstrate that expecting professors to actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise can compromise their objectivity, lead to a lack of diversity in viewpoints, and overlook the varied skills and interests of academics. These concerns work together to underscore the importance of maintaining a clear distinction between the role of professors as experts in their field and their potential roles as public advocates. By not obligating professors to engage in public advocacy, we can protect academic integrity, foster a diverse and inclusive academic environment, and ensure that professors can focus on their core responsibilities of research and teaching. Ultimately, this approach will better serve the pursuit of knowledge, the advancement of understanding, and the public interest.\n    </synthesis>\n</speech>",

However, this overlooks the fact that many fields of study, such as environmental science or public health, inherently involve issues of social and political relevance. Professors in these fields are not only experts but also have a responsibility to inform the public and policymakers about the implications of their research.

This can include training and resources for professors to develop their communication skills, as well as incentives for public engagement that recognize its value alongside research and teaching.

By providing resources, training, and recognition for public engagement, universities can ensure that professors are supported in their efforts, and their core responsibilities are not compromised. Additionally, highlighting successful models of public engagement that have enhanced academic work and public discourse can further bolster our argument.\n    </preemptiveDefense>\n    <weighing>\n        The most critical clash points in this debate are the potential impact of public advocacy on academic objectivity and the diversity of viewpoints within academia. Our challenges to the opposition's claims on these issues are pivotal because they directly address the core concerns raised against the proposition. By demonstrating that public advocacy can enhance academic discourse, inform policy decisions, and promote a diverse range of viewpoints without compromising objectivity, we establish a strong foundation for arguing that professors should engage in public advocacy. Ultimately, the debate hinges on recognizing the value of public engagement in enriching both academic work and societal discourse, and our responses provide a comprehensive argument in favor of this recognition.\n    </weighing>\n</rebuttal>",
      "closing": "<fFinalSpeech>\n    <framing>\n        At its core, this debate revolves around two central questions: Can professors maintain their academic integrity while engaging in public advocacy, and should they be expected to do so? The resolution, \"This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise,\" hinges on addressing these questions effectively. Our argument posits that not only can professors engage in public advocacy without compromising their objectivity, but they also have a responsibility to do so, given the societal implications of their research and expertise.\n    </framing>\n    <keyClashes>\n        <clash1>\n            <quote>\"The principle that professors' objectivity could be compromised by public advocacy assumes that taking a stance on a social or political issue inherently biases one's research or teaching.\"</quote>\n            <explanation>\n                Our evidence and principles are stronger because they demonstrate that public advocacy can actually enhance academic discourse by encouraging open discussion and critique of ideas. The opposition's response falls short by not adequately addressing how academic freedom includes the freedom to express opinions and engage in public discourse. This clash is crucial as it directly pertains to the heart of academic integrity and the role of professors in society.\n            </explanation>\n        </clash1>\n        <clash2>\n            <quote>\"Evidence from universities that have successfully implemented public engagement programs suggests that these initiatives can actually increase diversity in viewpoints.\"</quote>\n            <explanation>\n                The opposition's argument that public engagement leads to a lack of diversity in viewpoints is countered by our evidence showing that such programs can promote a more nuanced understanding of complex issues, thereby enhancing diversity. This makes our side stronger because it highlights the potential of public advocacy to enrich academic and public discourse. The opposition's claim overlooks the multifaceted nature of public engagement and its ability to foster a richer debate.\n            </explanation>\n        </clash2>\n        <clash3>\n            <quote>\"The principle of academic responsibility suggests that while not all professors may be inclined towards public advocacy, those who are should be supported and encouraged.\"</quote>\n            <explanation>\n                Our argument wins this clash by emphasizing the importance of institutional support for public engagement, including training and resources for professors. This approach recognizes the evolving role of academia in society and the value of public engagement alongside research and teaching. The opposition's concern about not all academics being equipped or interested is addressed by our flexible and supportive approach, making our stance more comprehensive and realistic.\n            </explanation>\n        </clash3>\n    </keyClashes>\n    <voting>\n        We win this debate by successfully addressing the core concerns raised against the proposition. Our arguments demonstrate that public advocacy can enhance academic objectivity, promote diversity of viewpoints, and align with the principles of academic responsibility. These points are crucial because they directly impact the role of professors in society, the integrity of academic work, and the potential for academia to contribute positively to public discourse. While the opposition raises valid concerns, our responses provide a more balanced and supportive approach to public engagement, recognizing both its benefits and the need for institutional support. Ultimately, our position that professors should engage in public advocacy is strengthened by our ability to address potential drawbacks and highlight the overall positive impact on academia and society.\n    </voting>\n</fFinalSpeech>"

      "logic": "**I. Core Judging Principles**  \n**I.1 Direct Clash Resolution**  \n**Clash 1: Academic Integrity and Objectivity**  \n- **Proposition**: Professors engaging in public advocacy enrich the academic community and foster informed discussions, citing evidence from AAUP and examples like Noam Chomsky and Cornel West.  \n- **Opposition**: Public advocacy compromises academic objectivity and integrity, as professors may align their work with political agendas, undermining credibility.  \n- **Analysis**: The Proposition\u2019s evidence is strong in showing societal benefits but does not fully address the Opposition\u2019s critique of bias. The Opposition\u2019s principle of academic integrity is robust, highlighting a critical risk. **Opposition wins this clash**.  \n\n**Clash 2: Diversity of Viewpoints**  \n- **Proposition**: Public advocacy promotes diversity of thought by amplifying academic voices in public discourse.  \n- **Opposition**: Advocacy risks self-censorship and homogenization of thought, as professors may avoid controversial opinions due to fear of backlash.  \n- **Analysis**: The Proposition\u2019s rebuttal with examples of successful public engagement initiatives is compelling, effectively countering the Opposition\u2019s evidence of self-censorship. **Proposition wins this clash**.  \n\n**Clash 3: Skills and Inclination for Advocacy**  \n- **Proposition**: Institutions should support professors in developing advocacy skills, recognizing diverse abilities.  \n- **Opposition**: Not all professors are equipped or interested in public advocacy, and expecting them to do so distracts from their core responsibilities.  \n- **Analysis**: The Proposition\u2019s focus on institutional support is stronger, as it mitigates the Opposition\u2019s concerns. **Proposition wins this clash**.  \n\n**I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact**  \n- **Proposition**: Core arguments center on societal enrichment, social responsibility, and policy impact. These are well-supported and logically linked, with high impact on public discourse and societal progress.  \n- **Opposition**: Core arguments focus on academic integrity, viewpoint diversity, and skill diversity. These are also strong, particularly the emphasis on preserving objectivity and diversity.  \n\n**I.3 Consistency and Contradictions**  \n- No internal contradictions or dropped arguments identified for either side. Both teams maintained consistency in their cases.  \n\n**II. Evaluation Requirements**  \n- **Steelmanning**: Both sides presented their arguments in strong, charitable forms.  \n- **Argument-Based Decision**: Decision based solely on the arguments provided in the debate.  \n- **Framework Neutrality**: Evaluated arguments within their respective frameworks without bias.  \n\n**III. Common Judging Errors to Avoid**  \n- No intervention, burden shifting, or over-reliance on real-world arguments. All clashes justified with detailed reasoning.  \n\n**IV. Decision Making**  \n- **Winner**: **Proposition**  \n- **Confidence Level**: **68** (Narrow Victory)  \n- **Key Factors**:  \n  1. The Proposition\u2019s effective rebuttals on diversity of viewpoints and institutional support for advocacy skills outweighed the Opposition\u2019s concerns about bias.  \n  2. The societal and policy impacts of advocacy presented by the Proposition had greater weight in resolving the motion.  \n\n**V. Line-by-Line Justification**  \n- **Proposition Opening Speech**: Provided strong evidence and principles to support public advocacy, linking societal enrichment, responsibility, and policy impact.  \n- **Opposition Opening Speech**: Raised valid concerns about bias, self-censorship, and skill diversity but lacked sufficient rebuttals to the Proposition\u2019s evidence.  \n- **Proposition Rebuttal**: Effectively countered the Opposition\u2019s critiques with examples and institutional solutions.  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal**: Challenged the Proposition\u2019s claims but did not fully undermine their core arguments.  \n- **Proposition Closing Speech**: Emphasized the societal and academic benefits of advocacy, reinforcing their case.  \n- **Opposition Closing Speech**: Reiterated concerns about bias and skill diversity but failed to outweigh the Proposition\u2019s arguments.  \n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>  \n<confidence>68</confidence>"
