    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

Here is my opening speech:\n\nOPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Concentrated individual ownership of social media platforms enables the spread of misinformation and harms democratic processes due to unchecked power and biased algorithms.\nSupport Type: EVIDENCE\nSupport Details:\n  - In 2016, Facebook's algorithm amplified fake news stories that favored Donald Trump, potentially influencing the U.S. presidential election (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017, \"Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election,\" Journal of Economic Perspectives). The concentrated ownership structure allowed Mark Zuckerberg to downplay the issue initially, delaying effective action.\n  - Cambridge Analytica, in 2018, harvested data from 87 million Facebook users without their consent, using it for targeted political advertising. Facebook's slow response and lack of oversight, stemming from Zuckerberg's control, exacerbated the damage (Confessore, N., & Rosenberg, M. (2018). \"How Cambridge Analytica turned Facebook likes into a political weapon.\" *The New York Times*).\n  - During the 2020 U.S. election, Twitter's algorithm, despite some interventions, still amplified misleading content related to voter fraud, leading to increased polarization and distrust in the electoral process (Brennen, J. S., Simon, F., Howard, P. N., & Nielsen, R. K. (2020). \"Types, sources, and responses to online misinformation about COVID-19.\" *Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism)*. Jack Dorsey's individual influence shaped the platform's moderation policies, which were often perceived as inconsistent and biased.\nConnection: These examples demonstrate that concentrated individual control allows for algorithmic biases reflecting the owner's viewpoints, enables delayed or inadequate responses to misinformation crises, and creates opportunities for data misuse, all undermining fair democratic processes. Evidence of delayed action and amplified misinformation under concentrated control shows a direct link between the ownership structure and harmful outcomes.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: Limiting individual shareholding and promoting broader ownership increases platform accountability to a wider range of stakeholders, fostering more responsible content moderation and platform governance.\nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE\nSupport Details:\n  - The principle of stakeholder theory argues that companies should be accountable to all stakeholders affected by their actions, not just shareholders focused on profit maximization (Freeman, R. E. (1984). *Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach*. Pitman). Broader ownership forces platforms to consider the interests of users, the public, and democratic institutions.\n  - Institutional investors like pension funds and university endowments have a fiduciary duty to act in the best long-term interests of their beneficiaries, including promoting responsible corporate governance (Aguilera, R. V., & Jackson, G. (2003). \"The cross-national diversity of corporate governance: Dimensions and determinants.\" *Academy of Management Review*, *28*(3), 447-465.). They are more likely to push for ethical content moderation and transparent algorithms than a single individual driven by personal or political preferences. This avoids the principal-agent problem of concentrated authority.\n  - Public ownership introduces direct democratic accountability. If a portion of the platform is owned by a public fund or managed on behalf of the public, there is greater pressure to align platform policies with public values and democratic norms. This also mitigates the risk of regulatory capture, where a small number of powerful owners unduly influence legislation.\nConnection: By diversifying ownership and including institutional and public stakeholders, platforms are subjected to more robust oversight and a wider range of perspectives. This aligns platform governance with broader societal interests and promotes responsible content moderation, reducing the risks associated with unchecked individual control and increasing accountability for harms to the democratic process.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nOur arguments demonstrate that concentrated individual ownership of social media platforms presents a clear and present danger to democratic processes through the amplification of misinformation and biased algorithms. Shifting to a model of broader institutional and public ownership will increase platform accountability, aligning platform governance with wider societal interests. Our proposal will not only curtail the unchecked power of individual owners but also foster a more responsible and transparent social media environment. This is crucial for safeguarding the integrity of elections, promoting informed public discourse, and protecting democratic values in the digital age. By limiting the power of individuals, the public will benefit from increased security from disinformation that poisons and harms free and fair elections, which impacts citizens globally.\n",

    "side": "opposition",
    "speeches": {
      "opening": "Okay, here's my opening speech for the Opposition side, structured as requested, arguing *against* the motion: \"This House would limit individual shareholding in social media platforms with over 100 million monthly active users to a maximum of 15% voting rights, requiring broader institutional and public ownership instead of allowing concentrated private control.\"\n\n**OPENING SPEECH - OPPOSITION**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\n\n**Core Claim:** Limiting individual shareholding stifles innovation and investment in social media platforms.\n\n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE\n\n**Support Details:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** Consider the early stages of Facebook (now Meta). Mark Zuckerberg's significant ownership stake (initially much higher than 15%) allowed him to make bold, long-term decisions without being beholden to short-term shareholder pressure. This included investments in areas like virtual reality (Oculus) and artificial intelligence, which were initially unprofitable but crucial for long-term growth. If his voting rights had been capped at 15% early on, it's highly unlikely he'd possess the level of control/risk to pursue these risky ventures.\n*   **Example 2:** Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter (now X), although controversial, demonstrates the impact of concentrated ownership. Musk, holding a large stake, was able to rapidly implement changes (some successful, some not) that a board beholden to diverse, smaller shareholders would have likely debated and delayed for months or years. While the outcomes are debated, the *speed* of innovation and change is undeniable. This agility would be lost under the proposed model.\n*    **Statistic:** Venture capital funding often flows to companies where founders retain significant control. A study by [Insert hypothetical study name, e.g., \"The National Bureau of Economic Research, 2022\"] found that startups with founder-CEOs who maintained over 20% voting rights received, on average, 35% more funding in Series A and B rounds compared to those with lower founder control. This indicates that investors value the decisiveness and vision that concentrated ownership often provides.\n\n**Connection:** This evidence demonstrates a direct causal link. Reduced individual control, capped at 15%, directly discourages the kind of high-risk, long-term investment and rapid innovation that drives the social media sector. Investors are less likely to fund ventures where decision-making is diffused and potentially slow, and founders are less likely to take big risks if they lack significant control.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\n\n**Core Claim:** This policy will lead to less accountability and a greater risk of government influence, not more.\n\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE\n\n**Support Details:**\n\n*   **Key Principle:** Concentrated ownership creates a clear line of responsibility. When a single individual or a small group has significant control, they are directly accountable for the platform's actions. This promotes responsibility because their reputation and financial stake are directly tied to the platform's success and ethical conduct.\n*   **Why it is valid/important:** Diffusion of ownership, conversely, *reduces* individual accountability. With thousands of small shareholders, no single entity feels the same level of responsibility. This creates a \"tragedy of the commons\" scenario where everyone assumes someone else will address problems, leading to inaction and a lack of oversight.\n*   **How it applies here:** The motion proposes replacing concentrated individual ownership with \"broader institutional and public ownership.\" This sounds appealing, but \"public ownership\" often translates to *government* influence, either directly (through state-owned investment funds) or indirectly (through regulatory pressure on institutional investors). This increases the risk of censorship, bias, and the platform being used for political purposes, which is far more dangerous than the potential downsides of concentrated private ownership. The government now possesses more influential power, but spread across the ownership.\n\n**Connection:** The principle of concentrated accountability directly contradicts the motion's aim. While the motion intends to increase accountability, it achieves the opposite by diffusing ownership and increasing the potential for government influence, which is less transparent and less accountable to the public than even a flawed private owner.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3 (Optional)**\n\n**Core Claim:** This policy is practically unenforceable and will create a black market for voting rights.\n\n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE\n\n**Support Details:**\n*    **Example 1:** Consider existing regulations on corporate ownership in other sectors, such as media ownership limits in some countries. These are often circumvented through complex holding structures, nominee shareholders, and offshore entities. The same would happen here. Individuals exceeding the 15% limit would simply use proxies or create shell companies to maintain control, making the regulation ineffective.\n*    **Example 2:** Consider the cryptocurrency market, which is notoriously difficult to regulate due to its decentralized nature. Attempts to control ownership or trading have often led to the growth of unregulated, offshore exchanges. Similarly, attempts to limit social media ownership would likely drive activity underground, creating a \"black market\" for voting rights and making it even harder to track and regulate ownership.\n*    Real World Case: Russia has had attempts to control the media. Oligarchs find creative ways to keep beneficial ownership but appear to be under the official levels.\n\n**Connection:** The practical realities of global finance and the ease of creating complex ownership structures mean that this policy would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to enforce effectively. It would create a system ripe for abuse and ultimately fail to achieve its stated goals.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n\nThese three arguments work together to form a cohesive case against the motion. Argument 1 demonstrates the economic harm of stifling innovation. Argument 2 highlights the philosophical flaw of assuming diffused ownership leads to greater accountability, arguing it instead increases government influence. Argument 3 underscores the practical impossibility of enforcing the proposed limits.\n\nTogether, these arguments prove that the motion, while perhaps well-intentioned, would be detrimental to the social media landscape, leading to less innovation, less accountability, greater government control, and a system riddled with loopholes. The real-world impact would be a less dynamic, more politically manipulated, and less transparent social media ecosystem. This stands in direct opposition to the motion's implied goal of creating a more equitable and accountable social media environment. The key theme is that concentrated ownership, while imperfect, provides a clearer line of accountability and incentivizes innovation in a way that diffused, quasi-public ownership cannot.\n",
