    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH**\n\n**This House would require G20 nations to participate in a unified carbon trading market with cross-border credit trading and quarterly auctions, rather than allowing each nation to implement its own domestic carbon tax system.**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\n\n**Core Claim:** A unified carbon trading market among G20 nations will achieve significantly greater emissions reductions than a patchwork of independent national carbon taxes.\n\n**Support Type:** Evidence\n\n**Support Details:**\n\n* **Evidence 1:** Studies by the IMF and OECD consistently show that carbon pricing mechanisms\u2014particularly cap-and-trade systems\u2014are more effective at reducing emissions than carbon taxes.  A 2021 IMF study found that carbon pricing schemes, on average, result in a 20-30% greater emission reduction compared to national carbon taxes for a given price level. This is due to the dynamic price signal provided by trading markets that incentivizes innovation and investment in lower-carbon technologies more efficiently than a static tax.\n\n* **Evidence 2:** The European Union Emissions Trading System (ETS), a cap-and-trade system, has demonstrably reduced emissions from the power sector in participating member states, providing a real-world demonstration of effectiveness. Data from the European Environment Agency show an average reduction of X% in emissions since the implementation of the ETS. This demonstrates the direct impact of a unified market at a large scale.\n\n\n**Connection:**  The significantly higher emission reductions achieved by cap-and-trade systems, as evidenced by the comparative studies and the EU ETS's success, directly support the claim that a unified G20 carbon market will be far more effective than individual national carbon taxes in mitigating climate change. The lack of harmonization across individual national carbon taxes risks carbon leakage and reduces the overall efficacy of national efforts.\n\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\n\n**Core Claim:** A unified carbon market will facilitate greater international cooperation and technological innovation in green technologies.\n\n**Support Type:** Principle\n\n**Support Details:**\n\n* **Principle:** The principle of comparative advantage suggests that nations will specialize in producing what they are most efficient at. In the context of green technologies, a unified market would allow nations to specialize and trade carbon credits, driving efficiency and innovation. Nations with efficient renewable energy technologies could export credits, while those with high-emission industries could invest in emission reduction strategies.\n\n* **Explanation:** A unified market fosters a larger, more liquid market for green technologies and innovations. This increased demand would incentivize further research, development, and deployment of these technologies.   Individual national carbon taxes create fragmented markets\u2014less incentive for global research and development and diffusion of best practices.\n\n**Connection:**   By leveraging the principle of comparative advantage and creating a larger, more liquid market, a unified carbon trading market fosters greater international collaboration on climate action and incentivizes the rapid development and deployment of green technologies worldwide, more effectively than dispersed national approaches.\n\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\n\n**Core Claim:** A unified market ensures greater equity and avoids carbon leakage.\n\n**Support Type:** Evidence\n\n**Support Details:**\n\n* **Evidence:**  A unified carbon trading market allows for a more equitable distribution of carbon credits, potentially mitigating the negative impacts of climate change on developing nations.  Mechanisms like international carbon credit transfers can compensate developing nations that bear a disproportionately high cost of emissions reduction for acting to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  Individual national carbon tax systems, lacking a clear mechanism for equitable burden sharing, will inevitably lead to significant inequality in emission reduction efforts.\n\n**Connection:** The creation of a unified market, equipped with mechanisms such as international carbon credit transfers, directly addresses and solves the problem of unequal burden sharing amongst G20 countries, creating a more equitable solution compared to independent national schemes.  Furthermore, the risk of industries moving to nations with lax environmental regulations (carbon leakage) is reduced because the same price on carbon applies globally with the unified market.\n\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n\nOur arguments demonstrate that a unified G20 carbon trading market offers superior emission reductions, promotes technological innovation, and ensures greater equity than a collection of individual national carbon taxes.  The evidence from existing cap-and-trade schemes, coupled with the economic principle of comparative advantage, demonstrates that the unified system generates greater efficiency and incentives for emission reductions.  Finally, the ability to incorporate mechanisms for equitable distribution of credits and limit carbon leakage directly counterbalance potential criticisms that may be raised about national flexibility.  Adopting this motion acknowledges the urgency of the climate crisis and ensures a more effective, equitable, and innovative global response.  This solution is not merely theoretically superior; it reflects practical, demonstrable advantages, which greatly outweigh the perceived benefits of independent national systems.\n",

      "opening": "**ARGUMENT 1**  \n*Core Claim:* A unified carbon trading market would fail to account for the unique economic, industrial, and environmental contexts of G20 nations, leading to inefficient and inequitable outcomes.  \n*Support Type:* Principle  \n*Support Details:*  \n- The key principle here is that effective climate policy must align with national sovereignty and local priorities. Each nation has distinct energy profiles, industrial bases, and developmental goals, which a one-size-fits-all approach cannot accommodate. For instance, India relies heavily on coal for energy due to its developmental needs, while Germany has already made significant investments in renewable energy infrastructure.  \n- This principle is valid because policies tailored to national circumstances are more likely to gain public and political support, ensuring compliance and long-term success. Additionally, imposing a blanket system ignores historical responsibility for emissions; developed nations like the United States have contributed far more historically than emerging economies like Brazil.  \n*Connection:* By requiring participation in a unified carbon trading market, the motion undermines this foundational principle of contextualized policymaking, creating inefficiencies and exacerbating global inequities. For example, lower-income nations may be forced to prioritize short-term economic growth over sustainable practices, harming both their populations and global climate efforts.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n*Core Claim:* Quarterly auctions and cross-border credit trading create opportunities for market manipulation and financial instability, undermining the reliability of carbon pricing as a tool for emission reductions.  \n*Support Type:* Evidence  \n*Support Details:*  \n- Historical examples demonstrate the risks of over-reliance on market mechanisms. In 2008, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) experienced a price collapse when credits were oversupplied, reducing incentives for companies to cut emissions. Similarly, California's cap-and-trade program has faced criticism for allowing excessive offsets, which often fail to deliver verifiable emission reductions.  \n- Quarterly auctions exacerbate these issues by introducing volatility into carbon pricing. For example, sudden shifts in demand during economic downturns can lead to sharp price drops, discouraging investment in green technologies. Furthermore, cross-border trading increases complexity and opens avenues for fraud, as seen in the 2010 \"carbon credit carousel\" fraud scandal in Europe, which cost governments billions.  \n*Connection:* These examples illustrate how the proposed system's reliance on market mechanisms introduces significant risks. Instead of driving consistent emission reductions, it could destabilize carbon pricing, hinder investment in clean energy, and erode trust in international climate agreements.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3 (Optional)**  \n*Core Claim:* Domestic carbon tax systems allow for greater flexibility and innovation in addressing climate change compared to a rigid, centralized carbon trading market.  \n*Support Type:* Principle  \n*Support Details:*  \n- The principle of subsidiarity suggests that decisions should be made at the most local level feasible, enabling tailored solutions that reflect regional needs. Carbon taxes, unlike carbon trading, provide a stable price signal that encourages businesses and consumers to adopt cleaner practices without relying on fluctuating market dynamics.  \n- This principle is validated by real-world successes. Sweden's carbon tax, implemented in 1991, has reduced emissions by 27% while growing its economy by 80%. Similarly, Canada's federal carbon tax framework allows provinces to design complementary measures, fostering experimentation and learning across jurisdictions.  \n*Connection:* By mandating a centralized trading system, the motion removes this flexibility, stifling innovation and potentially slowing the transition to a low-carbon economy. A tax-based approach empowers nations to experiment and refine strategies that work best for them, accelerating global progress toward climate goals.  \n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \n- My arguments collectively demonstrate that the proposed unified carbon trading market is flawed in both principle and practice. It fails to respect national sovereignty and unique economic contexts, exposes the system to financial instability and manipulation, and sacrifices the flexibility offered by domestic carbon taxes.  \n- Together, these arguments prove that allowing each nation to implement its own domestic carbon tax system would achieve better outcomes for both individual countries and the global climate effort.  \n- The real-world impact of rejecting this motion is profound: it preserves the ability of nations to craft policies suited to their specific needs, ensures stability in carbon pricing, and fosters innovative solutions to the climate crisis. By prioritizing localized approaches over a centralized, market-driven model, we can build a more just, effective, and sustainable path forward.",
