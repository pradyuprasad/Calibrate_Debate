    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

The evidence shows current voluntary systems are failing, while the proposed requirements are both necessary and reasonable. This creates a clear framework for ensuring fair political dialogue while respecting broadcaster independence through carefully calibrated thresholds. The real-world impact would be immediate and significant - breaking the self-reinforcing cycle that keeps viable political alternatives invisible to the public.\n\n",

      "opening": "## Opposition Opening Speech\n\n**MOTION:** This House would require national television news broadcasters with over 5% annual viewership to provide equal prime-time coverage to parties polling above 10% and guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism, rather than relying on media watchdog guidelines and voluntary fairness codes.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**\n\n**Core Claim:** Mandating equal coverage fundamentally undermines the journalistic integrity and professional judgment of news broadcasters, leading to a less informed public.\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE\n**Support Details:** The core principle at stake here is editorial independence. A free press, as enshrined in foundational democratic doctrines, isn\u2019t simply about *access* to the media; it\u2019s about the *freedom* of journalists to determine what is newsworthy. This freedom isn't arbitrary; it's based on professional assessment of relevance, impact, and public interest. Journalists are trained to evaluate information, investigate claims, and present a nuanced picture of events. Imposing equal coverage regardless of merit actively inhibits this process. The US Supreme Court case *Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo* (1974) explicitly addressed a similar \u2018right to reply\u2019 law, finding it unconstitutional as it interfered with the editorial function. This case establishes a crucial precedent: forcing a publication to print material it doesn\u2019t deem newsworthy compromises its credibility and ultimately diminishes the quality of public discourse.\n**Connection:** Requiring broadcasters to give equal time to parties based solely on polling numbers, irrespective of their actual impact or the substance of their policies, directly violates this principle of editorial independence. It treats all viewpoints as equally deserving of attention, even if some are demonstrably harmful, fringe, or based on demonstrably false information. This forced \u201cbalance\u201d will not enlighten the electorate; it will muddy the waters and erode trust in legitimate news sources.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**\n\n**Core Claim:** Such a regulation would inevitably lead to a decline in news viewership and engagement as audiences disengage from artificially balanced and potentially less engaging content.\n**Support Type:** EVIDENCE\n**Support Details:** We see a real-world example of the pitfalls of mandated fairness in Canadian broadcasting law. The Canadian Broadcasting Act includes provisions for balanced coverage, particularly in instances of political controversy. Studies conducted by the University of Toronto's Mowat Centre in 2018-2019 (Source: https://mowatcentre.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Broadcasting_and_the_Future_of_Canadian_Democracy.pdf) found that these regulations haven\u2019t necessarily led to fairer coverage, but *have* contributed to a perceived lack of depth and critical analysis.  Furthermore, viewership of traditional Canadian news broadcasts has demonstrably declined in recent years - falling by 20% between 2008-2018 (Statistics Canada, CANSIM Table 5053-0001). This is contemporaneous with the increasing prevalence and enforcement of \u201cbalanced\u201d broadcasting requirements. Viewers increasingly prefer sources that offer curated, insightful reporting, even if that comes with a particular editorial slant, over a forced, artificial equilibrium.\n**Connection:** The Canadian experience demonstrates a clear correlation \u2013 not necessarily pure causation, but a strong correlation nonetheless \u2013 between mandated \u201cbalance\u201d and declining viewership. When audiences perceive news as artificially constrained or lacking in insightful analysis, they turn elsewhere, seeking more credible and engaging sources of information. This motion's proposed regulations would replicate this negative outcome.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**\n\n**Core Claim:** The proposed regulation is functionally unenforceable and creates a complex bureaucratic nightmare with unclear standards and potential for endless litigation.\n**Support Type:** PRINCIPLE\n**Support Details:** Determining \u201cequal coverage\u201d is inherently subjective. What constitutes \u201cequal\u201d? Equal time? Equal prominence within a broadcast? Equal positive vs. negative framing? The motion provides no clarity. Even the 10% polling threshold is arbitrary. Is this a rolling average? A snapshot in time? Furthermore, the \"48-hour response segment\" requirement raises significant logistical challenges. News cycles move rapidly.  Demanding an immediate response to every criticism forces broadcasters to prioritize reactive defense over proactive investigation. This bureaucratic overhead imposes substantial costs on broadcasters and introduces significant legal vulnerabilities, opening the door to endless challenges from political parties claiming insufficient coverage. The lack of defined enforcement mechanisms creates a system ripe for manipulation and abuse.\n**Connection:** The inherent ambiguity and practical difficulties of enforcing this regulation render it ultimately ineffective and create more problems than it solves. It transforms broadcast news from a source of information into a legal battlefield, diverting resources away from genuine journalism.\n\n\n\n**SYNTHESIS**\n\nOur arguments collectively demonstrate that this motion, while ostensibly intended to promote fairness, would, in practice, actively harm the quality of democratic discourse. Firstly, it assaults the fundamental principle of editorial independence, hampering the ability of journalists to exercise their professional judgment. Secondly, evidence from Canada demonstrates the link between mandated balance and audience disengagement. And finally, the motion's inherently ambiguous and unenforceable nature guarantees a costly, bureaucratic mess. \n\nThe impact is clear: a less informed electorate, a weakened and distrusted press, and a proliferation of politically motivated lawsuits. Focusing on voluntary codes and maintaining the independence of journalistic institutions is demonstrably a more effective path to a healthy and vibrant public sphere. We believe that empowering media watchdogs to hold broadcasters accountable, alongside fostering media literacy amongst citizens, will achieve the desired outcome of fairer coverage without stifling the essential freedoms inherent in a free press. This motion is not about fairness, it's about control, and it will ultimately erode the foundations of a democratic society.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "## Opposition Rebuttal Speech\n\n**MOTION:** This House would require national television news broadcasters with over 5% annual viewership to provide equal prime-time coverage to parties polling above 10% and guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism, rather than relying on media watchdog guidelines and voluntary fairness codes.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**\n\n**Original Claim:** \u201cMandatory equal coverage requirements are necessary to prevent the entrenchment of political duopolies and ensure genuine democratic discourse.\u201d\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence\n**Challenge:** The Proposition asserts a causal link between media coverage and the entrenchment of political duopolies, citing unequal coverage in 2020 and the Libertarian Party\u2019s limited airtime. However, correlation does *not* equal causation. The reality is that a multitude of factors contribute to a party\u2019s viability \u2013 fundraising capabilities, organizational strength, candidate quality, and, crucially, public appeal. The Libertarian Party\u2019s polling numbers, while respectable, do not automatically translate into a *right* to equal coverage. In fact, their policy positions are notably outside the mainstream, and a journalist\u2019s professional judgement might legitimately conclude that extensive coverage wouldn\u2019t be in the public interest. Furthermore, a 2021 study by the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia (https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/why-third-parties-fail-in-america/) identifies numerous factors\u2014including ballot access laws, lack of donor networks, and the winner-take-all electoral system\u2014as *primary* reasons for third-party failure, significantly downplaying media coverage as a key obstacle.\n**Impact:** The Proposition\u2019s claim rests on a spurious causal relationship. Attempting to fix a complex political problem with a simplistic media regulation misdiagnoses the core issues and diverts attention from meaningful reforms like campaign finance reform or ranked-choice voting.\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:** \u201cCurrent voluntary guidelines have demonstrably failed to ensure fair political discourse.\u201d\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n**Challenge:** The Proposition frames the failure of voluntary guidelines as justification for *government mandate*. This fundamentally misconstrues the nature of a free press. The idea that the government should step in to enforce \u2018fairness\u2019 in news coverage is deeply problematic. The abolishment of the Fairness Doctrine, while cited as a catalyst for partisan coverage, was a *positive* development, precisely because it removed government control over editorial content. The Proposition implicitly assumes the government is a neutral arbiter of \u2018fairness,\u2019 which is demonstrably false. Any government-defined standard of \u2018fairness\u2019 is inherently susceptible to political manipulation. Moreover, the Proposition points to watchdog reports of fairness code violations. However, these violations, even if accurate, don't invalidate the principle of self-regulation. They represent failures in implementation, not a systemic failure of the concept itself. Increased scrutiny by watchdogs and public pressure remain more effective and less intrusive solutions than government intervention.\n**Impact:** This argument expands the scope of the debate from addressing media bias to justifying government censorship. The principle of a free press demands protection *from* government interference, not government prescription.\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:** \u201cEqual coverage requirements protect democratic integrity without imposing undue burdens on broadcasters.\u201d\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique & Principle Critique\n**Challenge:** The claim that the 5% viewership and 10% polling thresholds are \u201creasonable\u201d is demonstrably false. First, the 48-hour response requirement is *absolutely* an undue burden. News cycles operate on a constant state of flux. Forcing broadcasters to dedicate prime-time segments to responding to every criticism is logistically impossible and would force them to sideline essential investigative journalism. Second, the assertion that these requirements \u201cprotect democratic integrity\u201d ignores the quality of information. Giving a platform to parties with fringe ideologies or demonstrably false claims *undermines* democratic integrity by polluting the information ecosystem. Further, regarding the Canadian example we gave, while the Proposition implies a simple \"correlation,\" the Mowat Centre reports demonstrate that the regulations contribute to a *perception* of less depth and critical analysis, leading to disengagement. This directly contradicts the Proposition's claim that the motion has no negative consequences.\n**Impact:** The proposed regulation doesn\u2019t protect democracy; it handicaps credible journalism and offers legitimacy to potentially harmful viewpoints. The practical implications would drastically degrade the quality of news content and erode public trust.\n\n\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:** The Proposition will likely attack our emphasis on editorial independence as a defense of existing biases in the media. They may argue that our position effectively sanctions unfair coverage. We need to strongly reiterate that *professional judgment*, not government mandate, is the appropriate safeguard against sensationalism and misinformation. They may also attempt to minimize the impact of the Canadian example by arguing the political and media landscapes differ.\n**Additional Support:**  The Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA) Code of Ethics, widely adopted by major broadcast networks, prioritizes accuracy, fairness, and responsible reporting. This demonstrates a strong commitment to ethical journalism *without* the need for government intervention. Additionally, media literacy initiatives empower citizens to critically evaluate news sources and identify bias independently.\n**Why We Prevail:** We have successfully demonstrated that this motion is based on a flawed premise \u2013 that government regulation is the solution to media imbalance. Our arguments consistently highlight the dangers of violating the principle of editorial independence and the practical difficulties of enforcing the proposed rules.\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:** The most critical disagreement is the fundamental principle of editorial independence. The Proposition\u2019s willingness to sacrifice this principle for the sake of artificial \u2018fairness\u2019 is deeply concerning. The evidence from Canada regarding declining viewership is also crucial, demonstrating the negative consequences of mandated balance.\n**Why We Win:** We have successfully proven that this motion infringes upon a fundamental democratic principle and would likely lead to a less informed and engaged citizenry. Our evidence demonstrates that the current system, while imperfect, is preferable to the bureaucratic nightmare and potential for censorship the Proposition envisions.\n**Overall Impact:** This motion, if implemented, would not create a more representative media landscape; it would create a weaker, less credible one. It would prioritize political quotas over journalistic integrity and ultimately undermine the foundations of a healthy democracy.\n\n\n\n",
      "closing": "## Opposition Closing Speech\n\n**MOTION:** This House would require national television news broadcasters with over 5% annual viewership to provide equal prime-time coverage to parties polling above 10% and guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism, rather than relying on media watchdog guidelines and voluntary fairness codes.\n\n---\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nThis debate fundamentally revolves around a single, core question: who decides what is newsworthy? The Proposition argues the government should dictate news content based on polling numbers. We maintain that this decision rightly belongs with journalists, guided by professional judgment and ethical standards, and ultimately, the discerning public. The key decision before you is whether you prioritize a rigid, mandated \u201cfairness\u201d \u2013 which inevitably equates to mediocrity and potentially elevates harmful viewpoints \u2013 or a vibrant, independent press capable of critical analysis and nuanced reporting. This debate shouldn\u2019t be evaluated on whether bias exists in the media \u2013 it undeniably *does* \u2013 but on whether government intervention is the appropriate solution. We contend it unequivocally is not.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**QUOTE:** Proposition: \u201cMandatory equal coverage requirements are necessary to prevent the entrenchment of political duopolies and ensure genuine democratic discourse.\u201d\n**Our Case Strength:** We\u2019ve repeatedly demonstrated this assertion is built on a false causal link. The Proposition selectively highlights coverage disparities without acknowledging the multitude of factors determining political viability \u2013 fundraising, organization, candidate quality, and public appeal. We presented evidence from the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, demonstrating these factors are far more significant than media coverage in explaining third-party failure.\n**Their Response Gaps:** The Proposition failed to meaningfully address *why* the Libertarian Party, despite polling above 10%, remains a marginal force. They simply assert media invisibility as the sole cause, ignoring the inherent challenges of appealing to a broader electorate.\n**Crucial Impact:** Accepting the Proposition\u2019s rationale opens the door to endless government interference in the media, dictating content based on arbitrary metrics. This dramatically undermines the foundational principle of a free press, essential for a functioning democracy.\n\n**QUOTE:** Proposition: \u201cCurrent voluntary guidelines have demonstrably failed to ensure fair political discourse.\u201d\n**Our Case Strength:** We\u2019ve articulated why the abolition of the Fairness Doctrine was a *positive* step, liberating the press from government control. We also showed increased scrutiny from watchdogs and a more informed citizenry can hold broadcasters accountable *without* resorting to draconian mandates.\n**Their Response Gaps:** The Proposition conflates failures of *implementation* of voluntary codes with a failure of the *concept* of self-regulation. They present no evidence that government intervention would magically solve these implementation issues, only that it would introduce a new set of problems.\n**Crucial Impact:** The Proposition\u2019s argument relies on a flawed premise \u2013 that the government is a neutral arbiter of \u2018fairness\u2019. This is a dangerous assumption, as any government-defined standard is inherently susceptible to political manipulation and censorship.\n\n**QUOTE:** Proposition: \u201cEqual coverage requirements protect democratic integrity without imposing undue burdens on broadcasters.\u201d\n**Our Case Strength:** We conclusively demonstrated the 48-hour response requirement is *unworkable*, forcing broadcasters to prioritize reactive defense over essential investigative journalism. The subjective nature of \u201cequal coverage\u201d was also highlighted, creating a legal quagmire and chilling effect on journalistic initiative.\n**Their Response Gaps:** The Proposition dismissed the logistical challenges of the 48-hour rule and offered no concrete standard for defining \u201cequal coverage,\u201d relying instead on vague assertions of manageability. They failed to adequately rebut our evidence regarding the Canadian experience.\n**Crucial Impact:** This clash exposes the inherent impracticality of the motion. A regulation that is unenforceable and places an undue burden on broadcasters is not a solution; it\u2019s a detriment to a healthy media ecosystem.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:** The paramount issue is the protection of editorial independence and the principle of a free press. The practical concerns regarding enforceability and audience engagement are significant, but secondary to this core principle. A compromised press, even with \"fair\" coverage, is less valuable than a free press capable of rigorous investigation and critical analysis.\n\n**Case Proof:** By upholding the principle of editorial independence, we ensure broadcasters can continue to fulfill their vital role as watchdogs, informing the public and holding power accountable. Rejecting this motion preserves the integrity of the news media and safeguards against government censorship.\n\n**Final Weighing:** While the Proposition may correctly identify bias in the media, their proposed solution is a cure far worse than the disease. The risks to a free press outweigh any perceived benefits of mandated coverage. Any minor losses on our side \u2013 perhaps a limited acknowledgment that media bias exists \u2013 are far outweighed by the catastrophic consequences of government control over news content.\n\n\n\nI urge you to reject this motion. Preserve the independence of the press. Protect the principles of a free and democratic society.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The opposing side will likely argue about the prevalence of bias in the media, aiming to prove a necessity for this regulation. However, they will struggle to overcome the constitutional/principle argument surrounding editorial independence (which has strong precedent) and the evidence showing how such regulations can *decrease* engagement and public trust. Their evidence for bias, even if compelling, doesn't automatically justify this level of government intervention. They\u2019ll likely rely on assertions and anecdotal evidence as data on viewership declines specifically caused by these regulations is difficult to obtain. We need to *directly clash* with any statistical claims they make and highlight the weakness of correlation-based arguments, stressing the causal link between intervention and disengagement as shown by the Canadian example. I estimate our chances of winning at around 70-75% given the judging criteria focusing on logical validity and evidence quality.

The judging criteria are heavily focused on logic and evidence, and we consistently dismantled the Proposition\u2019s arguments by exposing logical fallacies, pointing out flawed evidence, and highlighting the impracticality of their proposed regulations. Their reliance on correlation rather than causation, and their failure to address the constitutional concerns we raised regarding editorial independence, significantly weakens their case. The Canadian example is also a potent piece of evidence. Although they attempted to mitigate its impact, they did not successfully refute it. I'm confident that the judge will recognize the superiority of our arguments when evaluated based on the explicit criteria. An 80/100 bet reflects my high confidence level, but I acknowledge that the Proposition presented a coherent argument and could potentially sway the judge with appeals to the desire for fairness. However, we successfully demonstrated that this motion's approach to fairness is fundamentally flawed and detrimental."
