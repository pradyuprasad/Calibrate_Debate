    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "closing": "Ladies and gentlemen, as we arrive at the conclusion of this debate, let\u2019s revisit the core questions and the key clashes that lie at the heart of our argument: whether professors should engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their fields of expertise. \n\n**Key Clashes:**\n\n1. **The Responsibility of Professors:** Our original claim emphasized that professors have an ethical obligation to leverage their expertise to inform public discourse. The opposition argued that engaging in advocacy jeopardizes the objectivity of academia. However, we have demonstrated that objectivity does not equate to silence. Academic inquiry thrives on evidence-based opinions, and many fields demand that their experts speak out when their research is relevant to public wellbeing. Examples from public health during crises reinforce that advocacy can stem from a place of knowledge, not bias, thereby enriching public discourse rather than undermining it.\n\n2. **Enhancing the Relevance of Academia:** The opposition challenged our assertion that advocacy heightens the relevance of academic work by claiming it alienates students. However, we countered this with evidence that diverse viewpoints can be encouraged alongside advocacy, promoting a robust academic environment. Institutions can foster open dialogue even when professors are outspoken, showing that a commitment to inclusivity can run parallel to the act of advocacy.\n\n3. **Encouraging Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** While the opposition suggested that advocacy oversimplifies complex issues, we reinforced that interdisciplinary collaboration enriches academic discourse. Professors frequently work together across disciplines, ensuring that their advocacy ventures are well-rounded and thoughtful, reflecting the complexity of the challenges at hand.\n\n**Voting:**\n\nThe clashing points that matter most are those regarding the responsibility of professors and the enhancement of academia's relevance. Our arguments strengthen the case that advocacy is not only appropriate but also essential in applying academic knowledge to societal dilemmas. The opposition's fears around objectivity and alienation are mitigated by our emphasis on evidence and open dialogue, undermining any valid concerns they presented.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown compellingly why the engagement of professors in public advocacy contributes positively to society. It upholds the integrity of their expertise, fosters a more informed citizenry, and encourages a collaborative approach necessary for tackling today\u2019s pressing issues. \n\nTherefore, we affirm that this House believes professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their fields of expertise. Thank you."

      "closing": "### Final Speech: Why the Proposition Wins\n\n#### Framing\nThis debate ultimately comes down to one core question: **Should professors use their expertise to actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field?** The proposition argues that this engagement is not only beneficial but necessary for societal progress, while the opposition claims it risks undermining academic integrity and inclusivity. However, the proposition\u2019s case demonstrates that the benefits of advocacy far outweigh the risks, and the opposition\u2019s concerns are either overstated or addressable.\n\n#### Key Clashes\n1. **Objectivity vs. Advocacy**  \n   - **Opposition Claim:** Professors engaging in advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions.  \n   - **Proposition Response:** Objectivity is not about neutrality but about rigorous, evidence-based inquiry. Advocacy grounded in research, as seen in fields like public health, enhances credibility rather than diminishing it.  \n   - **Why We Win:** The opposition conflates advocacy with bias, but evidence-based advocacy aligns with the core principles of academia. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, public health experts advocated for mask mandates and vaccinations based on research, which was widely accepted as both objective and necessary. This reframes advocacy as an extension of academic responsibility, not a threat to it.  \n\n2. **Inclusivity and Alienation**  \n   - **Opposition Claim:** Public advocacy can alienate students and colleagues with differing views.  \n   - **Proposition Response:** Advocacy can coexist with inclusivity when professors model respectful dialogue and encourage diverse perspectives. Institutions like Harvard and Stanford demonstrate this balance effectively.  \n   - **Why We Win:** The opposition\u2019s evidence is incomplete and fails to account for the role of academic institutions in fostering constructive debate. Advocacy does not inherently exclude differing views; it can enrich discourse when handled responsibly.  \n\n3. **Expertise and Interdisciplinary Collaboration**  \n   - **Opposition Claim:** Professors may lack the expertise or mandate to engage in public advocacy on complex issues.  \n   - **Proposition Response:** Interdisciplinary collaboration ensures that advocacy is well-informed and balanced. For example, climate change advocacy involves scientists, economists, and policymakers working together.  \n   - **Why We Win:** The opposition\u2019s concern about expertise is mitigated by the collaborative nature of academia. Professors are not isolated experts; they work across disciplines to address multifaceted issues, ensuring that advocacy is both informed and effective.  \n\n#### Voting\nThe proposition wins this debate because we have successfully addressed the opposition\u2019s core concerns and demonstrated that the benefits of advocacy far outweigh the risks.  \n\n1. **Objectivity and Advocacy:** We reframed advocacy as evidence-based and aligned with academic principles, neutralizing the opposition\u2019s primary argument about credibility.  \n2. **Inclusivity and Alienation:** We showed that advocacy can coexist with inclusivity when handled responsibly, undermining the opposition\u2019s claim about alienation.  \n3. **Expertise and Collaboration:** We highlighted the role of interdisciplinary collaboration in ensuring that advocacy is well-informed and balanced, addressing the opposition\u2019s concern about expertise.  \n\nThese key clashes matter most because they directly address the opposition\u2019s foundational arguments. By winning these points, we prove that professors\u2019 engagement in public advocacy is not only justified but essential for leveraging academic expertise to address societal challenges. The benefits of informed, evidence-based advocacy\u2014such as fostering public awareness, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, and driving societal progress\u2014outweigh any potential risks.  \n\nIn conclusion, the proposition\u2019s case stands stronger because it aligns with the core mission of academia: to use knowledge for the betterment of society. We urge you to vote in favor of the motion."

      "logic": "### I. Core Judging Principles\n\n#### 1. Direct Clash Resolution\n\nLet us carefully analyze each major clash identified between the Proposition and Opposition. \n\n---\n\n**CLASH 1: Objectivity vs. Advocacy**  \n- **Proposition Position** (Opening Speech, Argument 1): Professors have an ethical duty to apply their expertise to public discourse on social and political issues, grounded in the principle of social responsibility. Advocacy is framed as evidence-based and objective.  \n  - *Quoted Claim*: \"The principle of social responsibility dictates that individuals with specialized knowledge should contribute to societal betterment.\"  \n- **Opposition Position** (Opening Speech, Argument 1): Advocacy risks undermining the perceived objectivity of academic institutions, eroding public trust.  \n  - *Quoted Claim*: \"When professors take public stances on social and political issues, it can create the perception that their research and teachings are influenced by personal or political agendas.\"  \n\n**Logical Validity**:  \n- **Proposition**: The argument that advocacy is a natural extension of evidence-based inquiry is logically strong. It aligns with examples like public health advocacy during crises, where experts\u2019 actions were widely accepted as objective. The Proposition successfully reframes advocacy as a continuation of academic rigor, not a departure from it.  \n- **Opposition**: The argument assumes that advocacy inherently compromises objectivity, but it fails to account for the distinction between evidence-based advocacy and ideological activism. This weakens its logical foundation.  \n\n**Evidence Quality**:  \n- **Proposition**: The Proposition uses the example of public health advocacy during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., mask mandates, vaccination campaigns) to support its claim. This is specific, verifiable, and highly relevant.  \n- **Opposition**: The Opposition relies on a general principle of academic objectivity without providing specific examples or evidence of how advocacy has harmed academic institutions. This lack of direct evidence weakens its case.  \n\n**Rebuttal Effectiveness**:  \n- **Proposition Rebuttal**: Challenges the Opposition\u2019s argument by distinguishing between evidence-based advocacy and bias, citing public health examples.  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal**: Attempts to reframe advocacy as inherently biased but fails to counter the Proposition\u2019s distinction between rigorous inquiry and activism.  \n\n**Winner of Clash**: **Proposition**  \nThe Proposition wins this clash because it successfully reframes advocacy as evidence-based and aligned with academic principles, neutralizing the Opposition\u2019s primary concern about objectivity. The Opposition\u2019s lack of specific evidence further weakens its argument.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH 2: Inclusivity and Alienation**  \n- **Proposition Position** (Opening Speech, Argument 2): Public advocacy enhances the relevance of academia and fosters public awareness.  \n  - *Quoted Claim*: \"When professors participate in public advocacy, they increase public awareness and interest in their fields.\"  \n- **Opposition Position** (Opening Speech, Argument 2): Advocacy can alienate students and colleagues with differing views, creating a chilling effect and hindering intellectual diversity.  \n  - *Quoted Claim*: \"When professors express strong political opinions, it can create a chilling effect in classrooms, where students with opposing perspectives feel marginalized.\"  \n\n**Logical Validity**:  \n- **Proposition**: The argument that advocacy can coexist with inclusivity is logically sound. It is supported by examples of institutions like Harvard and Stanford, which successfully integrate advocacy with open dialogue.  \n- **Opposition**: The claim about alienation relies on studies but does not consider how institutions can mitigate these effects by fostering respectful discourse. This introduces a logical flaw in assuming causation without addressing alternative solutions.  \n\n**Evidence Quality**:  \n- **Proposition**: The Proposition uses specific examples (Harvard, Stanford) to demonstrate that advocacy and inclusivity are not mutually exclusive. This is verifiable and directly relevant.  \n- **Opposition**: The Opposition cites studies about alienation but fails to address how advocacy can be balanced with inclusivity. This undermines the strength of its evidence.  \n\n**Rebuttal Effectiveness**:  \n- **Proposition Rebuttal**: Effectively counters the Opposition\u2019s claim by arguing that advocacy can coexist with inclusivity when handled responsibly.  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal**: Fails to address the Proposition\u2019s evidence or examples, weakening its response.  \n\n**Winner of Clash**: **Proposition**  \nThe Proposition wins this clash because it provides stronger evidence and successfully counters the Opposition\u2019s claim by showing that advocacy and inclusivity are compatible.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH 3: Expertise and Interdisciplinary Collaboration**  \n- **Proposition Position** (Opening Speech, Argument 3): Advocacy encourages interdisciplinary collaboration, enriching academic discourse.  \n  - *Quoted Claim*: \"Engaging in public advocacy encourages professors to work across disciplines, integrating insights from various academic fields.\"  \n- **Opposition Position** (Opening Speech, Argument 3): Professors may lack the expertise or mandate to engage in advocacy on complex issues.  \n  - *Quoted Claim*: \"Social and political issues often involve interdisciplinary complexities that extend beyond their area of specialization.\"  \n\n**Logical Validity**:  \n- **Proposition**: The argument that interdisciplinary collaboration addresses the complexity of advocacy is logically strong and supported by examples like climate change advocacy.  \n- **Opposition**: The claim about expertise is weakened by the lack of specific examples of how advocacy has led to oversimplification or harm.  \n\n**Evidence Quality**:  \n- **Proposition**: Specific examples of interdisciplinary collaboration in climate change advocacy (scientists, economists, policymakers) strengthen the argument.  \n- **Opposition**: The Opposition\u2019s argument lacks verifiable evidence of harm caused by professors\u2019 advocacy, reducing its impact.  \n\n**Rebuttal Effectiveness**:  \n- **Proposition Rebuttal**: Successfully counters the Opposition by emphasizing the role of collaboration in mitigating concerns about expertise.  \n- **Opposition Rebuttal**: Offers no new evidence or arguments to challenge the Proposition\u2019s response.  \n\n**Winner of Clash**: **Proposition**  \nThe Proposition wins this clash because it provides stronger evidence and effectively addresses the Opposition\u2019s concerns about expertise.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact  \n\n**Core Arguments**:  \n- **Proposition**: Responsibility to leverage expertise, relevance of academia, and interdisciplinary collaboration.  \n- **Opposition**: Objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise limits.  \n\n**Logical Links**:  \n- The Proposition\u2019s arguments are well-supported and interconnected, with clear links between advocacy, societal relevance, and interdisciplinary collaboration.  \n- The Opposition\u2019s arguments are less cohesive, as the concerns about objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise are addressed and mitigated by the Proposition.  \n\n**Impact**:  \n- The Proposition\u2019s arguments have greater societal impact, emphasizing the role of professors in addressing urgent social and political challenges.  \n- The Opposition\u2019s arguments focus on risks but fail to provide compelling evidence of actual harm.  \n\n**Principled vs. Practical Arguments**:  \n- The Proposition balances principled arguments (social responsibility) with practical evidence (public health advocacy).  \n- The Opposition\u2019s principled arguments (objectivity) are less persuasive due to a lack of practical support.  \n\n---\n\n#### 3. Consistency and Contradictions  \n\n- **Proposition**: No significant contradictions or inconsistencies.  \n- **Opposition**: The arguments about alienation and expertise are somewhat repetitive and lack specificity.  \n\n---\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements  \n\n- **Steelmanning**: All arguments have been analyzed in their strongest possible form.  \n- **Argument-Based Decision**: The decision is based solely on the provided arguments.  \n- **Framework Neutrality**: Both sides\u2019 frameworks have been evaluated fairly.  \n\n---\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID  \n\n- **No Intervention**: The judge introduced no external arguments or evidence.  \n- **No Shifting Burden of Proof**: Both sides were held to the same standard of proof.  \n- **No Ignoring Dropped Arguments**: All arguments were addressed.  \n\n---\n\n### IV. Decision Making  \n\n**Winner**: **Proposition**  \n**Confidence Level**: 85  \n\n---\n\n#### Key Factors  \n\n1. **Objectivity vs. Advocacy**: The Proposition successfully reframed advocacy as evidence-based and aligned with academic principles.  \n2. **Inclusivity and Alienation**: The Proposition provided stronger evidence that advocacy and inclusivity can coexist.  \n\n#### Detailed Reasoning  \n\nThe Proposition wins decisively due to its superior evidence, logical rigor, and effective rebuttals. The Opposition\u2019s arguments lacked specificity and failed to counter the Proposition\u2019s claims effectively. The Proposition\u2019s focus on evidence-based advocacy, inclusivity, and interdisciplinary collaboration demonstrated the benefits of professors engaging in public advocacy.  \n\n---\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification  \n\n1. **Proposition Opening Speech**: All three arguments (responsibility, relevance, collaboration) were addressed, with clear analysis of their logical links and evidence.  \n2. **Opposition Opening Speech**: The concerns about objectivity, inclusivity, and expertise were analyzed, highlighting the lack of specific evidence.  \n3. **Proposition Rebuttal**: Effectively countered the Opposition\u2019s claims, emphasizing evidence-based advocacy and inclusivity.  \n4. **Opposition Rebuttal**: Attempted to defend initial claims but failed to provide new evidence or compelling counterarguments.  \n5. **Proposition Closing Speech**: Restated the core arguments and linked them to the Proposition\u2019s overall case.  \n6. **Opposition Closing Speech**: Reiterated key points but failed to address the Proposition\u2019s stronger evidence and rebuttals.  \n\n---\n\n```xml\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>85</confidence>\n```"
