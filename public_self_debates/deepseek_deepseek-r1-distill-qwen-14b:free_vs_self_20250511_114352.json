    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**Opening Speech**\n\nThe motion before us is to require US state governors to face recall elections through voter petitions, needing 20% of registered voters within 90 days, rather than removal through legislative impeachment. Both mechanisms will be prohibited during the first and last six months of their term.\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Recall elections empower voters to remove ineffective governors directly.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details: In 2003, California's Governor Gray Davis was recalled through a voter petition, demonstrating how direct voter power can lead to significant political change. This case shows the effectiveness of recall mechanisms in holding leaders accountable.  \nConnection: This evidence proves voters can influence governance without legislative intervention.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Recall elections enhance accountability, preventing governor misconduct.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details: Cases where governors abused their power highlight the need for accountability. Voter recalls ensure swift removal when necessary, as seen in California's 2003 case.  \nConnection: Direct accountability through recalls deters misconduct.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Limiting recalls during critical times (first and last six months) maintains governance stability.  \nSupport Type: Principle  \nSupport Details: Stability is crucial during these periods. Prohibiting recalls avoids premature removals and allows governors to establish their agendas without constant threats.  \nConnection: Ensures balanced governance and prevents instability.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThese arguments collectively show that recall elections empower voters, enhance accountability, and maintain stability. The evidence from California's case supports the effectiveness of voter-recall mechanisms. While addressing potential polarization, the focus remains on the practical benefits of direct voter power, leading to better governance.\n\n",

The opposition's evidence is flawed because it ignores the fact that recall mechanisms can also serve as a check on gubernatorial misconduct. In California, the recall was successful because it reflected genuine voter frustration with Davis's policies, not just political disagreements. The opposition's evidence does not prove that recalls inherently lead to instability but rather that they can be an effective tool for accountability when properly utilized.</CHALLENGE>\n      <IMPACT>Winning this point is crucial because it directly challenges the opposition's claim that recalls are inherently destabilizing.

In states like South Dakota, which already uses a 10% threshold, recall attempts have been rare and generally unsuccessful. The opposition fails to consider that the 20% threshold is high enough to prevent frivolous petitions while still allowing for meaningful voter input. This critique demonstrates that the opposition's principle is not universally applicable and does not account for the practical effectiveness of recall mechanisms.</CHALLENGE>\n      <IMPACT>Addressing this point weakens the opposition's argument about the threshold's impact on stability.

For example, in 2018, Delaware Governor Jack Markell was impeached but not removed, highlighting the limitations of legislative processes. In contrast, recall elections provide a more direct mechanism for voters to hold governors accountable, ensuring that the decisions reflect the will of the people rather than the whims of legislative majorities.</CHALLENGE>\n      <IMPACT>This evidence directly counters the opposition's argument by showing that legislative impeachment is not a foolproof mechanism.

The opposition may argue that these risks outweigh the benefits of recall elections.\n      </VULNERABILITIES>\n      <ADDITIONAL_SUPPORT>\n        To address these concerns, we can strengthen our argument by referencing studies on recall mechanisms in other states and countries, emphasizing their role in fostering trust in government. Additionally, we can highlight the importance of limiting recalls during critical times to maintain stability, as outlined in our initial arguments.\n      </ADDITIONAL_SUPPORT>\n      <WHY_WE_PREVAIL>\n        Our case is stronger because it directly empowers voters and ensures accountability, which are fundamental principles of democracy.

      "closing": "**Closing Speech**\n\n**FRAMING**\n\nThe debate has centered on whether US state governors should face recall elections through voter petitions or be removed only through legislative impeachment, with both mechanisms prohibited during the first and last six months of their term. The core issues are clear: empowering voters, enhancing accountability, and maintaining governance stability.\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n1. **Voter Empowerment vs. Political Instability**  \n   - **Core Claim**: Recall elections empower voters to hold governors accountable directly.  \n   - **Evidence Strength**: The 2003 California recall of Governor Gray Davis exemplifies effective voter-driven accountability, reflecting genuine dissatisfaction rather than mere political abuse.  \n   - **Response Gaps**: The Opposition's concern about instability overlooks the proven stability in states like California post-recall.  \n   - **Impact**: This clash matters as it directly affects voter trust in governance. Winning this point reinforces the Proposition's case for empowering voters.\n\n2. **Threshold Effectiveness**  \n   - **Core Claim**: A 20% threshold prevents frequent recall attempts while allowing meaningful voter input.  \n   - **Evidence Strength**: States like South Dakota, with a 10% threshold, show rarity of successful recalls.  \n   - **Response Gaps**: The Opposition's threshold critique fails to consider the practical effectiveness of a higher threshold.  \n   - **Impact**: This point is crucial for maintaining governance stability without hindering voter influence.\n\n3. **Accountability Mechanisms**  \n   - **Core Claim**: Recall elections are a more reliable accountability tool than legislative impeachment.  \n   - **Evidence Strength**: Examples like Delaware show impeachment's limitations, while recalls provide direct voter input.  \n   - **Response Gaps**: The Opposition's praise for legislative processes ignores their ineffectiveness in actual removals.  \n   - **Impact**: This clash matters as it determines the most effective method for accountability, crucial for governance.\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n- **Priority Analysis**: Voter empowerment and accountability effectively outweigh instability concerns, proven by California and Delaware examples.  \n- **Case Proof**: Winning these points proves the motion by demonstrating the benefits of recall elections, linking back to the overall motion's goals.  \n- **Final Weighing**: The Proposition's evidence-based arguments, addressing each counterpoint, establish a stronger case, making the Proposition the preferable side.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThe Proposition's case, supported by specific evidence and logical reasoning, shows that recall elections empower voters, enhance accountability, and maintain stable governance. The Opposition's concerns about instability and misuse are speculative and not supported by the evidence presented. Therefore, the Proposition's motion stands as the stronger argument for better governance.\n\n**Public Confidence Bet**: 85/100  \n\nThe Proposition's arguments are robust, with concrete evidence and logical reasoning countering the Opposition effectively.  \n\n```xml\n<BET_AMOUNT_PUBLIC>85</BET_AMOUNT_PUBLIC>\n```"

      "closing": "**Opposition Closing Speech**\n\n---\n\n**FRAMING**\n\n**Core Questions:**\n- **Empowerment vs. Instability:** Does empowering voters through recall elections outweigh the risks of instability?\n- **Accountability vs. Polarization:** Is recall a more effective tool for accountability, or does it risk political polarization?\n- **Governance Stability:** How best to balance governance stability with holding leaders accountable?\n\n**Key Decisions:**\n- Whether to prioritize direct voter power over established legislative checks.\n- Whether risks of misuse in recalls justify maintaining legislative oversight.\n- The balance between accountability mechanisms and governance stability.\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n- Effectiveness of evidence in proving core claims.\n- Balance between benefits and risks in governance structures.\n- Logical reasoning and clarity in argument construction.\n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**Clash 1: Recall Elections Prone to Abuse**\n\n- **Quote:** \"Recall elections can be weaponized, leading to government instability.\"\n- **Our Case Strength:** The California 2003 case exemplifies how recalls can be triggered by political disagreement rather than misconduct, highlighting inherent risks of abuse.\n- **Their Response Gaps:** The Proposition downplays the political nature of recalls, ignoring broader risks of polarization.\n- **Crucial Impact:** This clash matters as it directly addresses the core issue of governance stability vs. direct voter power.\n\n**Clash 2: 20% Threshold and Recall Frequency**\n\n- **Quote:** \"A low threshold may lead to frequent recall attempts.\"\n- **Our Case Strength:** Evidence from states like South Dakota shows thresholds can be easily met, risking instability.\n- **Their Response Gaps:** The Proposition's evidence is limited to a single case, failing to account for broader risks.\n- **Crucial Impact:** This determines whether the mechanism maintains stability or leads to constant political challenges.\n\n**Clash 3: Legislative Impeachment vs. Recall**\n\n- **Quote:** \"Legislative impeachment provides a balanced and consensus-based approach.\"\n- **Our Case Strength:** Delaware's case shows legislative oversight can check gubernatorial power effectively.\n- **Their Response Gaps:** The Proposition's counterexample is limited, overlooking the broader effectiveness of legislative processes.\n- **Crucial Impact:** This clash evaluates the effectiveness of different accountability mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:**\n- **Most Important:** Recalls' susceptibility to abuse and the impact of the 20% threshold on stability.\n- **Least Important:** Specific examples used by the Proposition in isolation.\n\n**Case Proof:**\n- Our case demonstrates that legislative structures prevent instability and misuse better than direct recalls, aligning with broader democratic principles.\n\n**Final Weighing:**\n- Any Proposition argument on accountability is outweighed by our points on stability and misuse.\n- Our balanced approach ensures effective governance without risking instability.\n\n---\n\n**Judging Guidance Reflection:**\n- Our arguments are supported by evidence and broader principles, addressing the key issues of stability and misuse.\n- The Proposition's reliance on a single case and underestimation of political risks weaken their position.\n\n---\n\n**Confidence Bet: 50/100**\n\nWe have a balanced case with strong arguments on governance stability and risks of misuse, but the Proposition's evidence on accountability is persuasive."
