    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\nARGUMENT 1  \nCore Claim: Recall elections through voter petitions undermine democratic stability by creating constant political uncertainty.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details:  \n- In California, the 2003 recall election of Governor Gray Davis cost the state $66 million and created months of political instability, diverting attention from critical policy issues.  \n- In Venezuela, the 2004 recall referendum against President Hugo Chavez led to prolonged political polarization and social unrest, demonstrating how recall mechanisms can exacerbate division.  \nConnection: These examples show that recall elections disrupt governance and create instability, which is counterproductive to effective leadership and public trust.  \n\nARGUMENT 2  \nCore Claim: A 20% voter petition threshold is too low and risks abuse by well-organized minority groups.  \nSupport Type: Principle  \nSupport Details:  \n- Democratic systems are designed to protect against the \"tyranny of the minority,\" where small but vocal groups can impose their will on the majority.  \n- A 20% threshold is easily achievable by special interest groups or political factions, allowing them to weaponize recall elections for partisan gain rather than legitimate governance concerns.  \nConnection: This principle demonstrates that a low threshold undermines the democratic process by enabling minority groups to disrupt governance without broad public support.  \n\nARGUMENT 3  \nCore Claim: Prohibiting removal during the first and last 6 months of a term creates unnecessary rigidity and limits accountability.  \nSupport Type: Evidence  \nSupport Details:  \n- In Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker faced a recall election in 2012 during his second year in office, which allowed voters to hold him accountable for controversial policies early in his term.  \n- Prohibiting recalls during the first 6 months prevents voters from addressing urgent issues, while the last 6 months restriction shields governors from accountability for unpopular end-of-term decisions.  \nConnection: These examples show that such restrictions limit voters' ability to hold leaders accountable when it matters most, undermining the purpose of recall mechanisms.  \n\nSYNTHESIS  \nThese arguments work together to demonstrate that recall elections through voter petitions, especially with a low threshold and restrictive timeframes, are detrimental to democratic stability and accountability. They create opportunities for abuse, disrupt governance, and limit voters' ability to hold leaders accountable effectively. This unified case shows why the current system of state legislative impeachment is a more balanced and effective mechanism for addressing gubernatorial misconduct.  \n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Recall elections through voter petitions undermine the stability and effectiveness of governance by creating constant political uncertainty.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- While governance stability is important, the principle of direct accountability to voters is equally critical in a democracy. The opposition's argument assumes that stability is inherently more valuable than accountability, but this is a false dichotomy.  \n- The examples of California and Venezuela cited in our opening speech show that while recalls can cause short-term disruption, they also serve as a necessary check on leaders who fail to represent the public interest.  \n- The opposition's principle fails to account for the fact that instability caused by recalls is often a symptom of deeper governance issues, not the recall mechanism itself.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it challenges the opposition's foundational assumption that stability should always take precedence over accountability, which is central to their case.  \n\n**CLASH PO 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"The 20% voter petition threshold is overly burdensome and risks disenfranchising the majority of voters.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The principle of majority rule does not mean that minority voices should be entirely silenced. A 20% threshold ensures that recalls are not triggered frivolously while still allowing significant public discontent to be addressed.  \n- The opposition's argument conflates the ability of a minority to initiate a recall with the outcome of the recall election itself, which is still decided by the majority of voters.  \n- Our principle of balanced democracy recognizes that minority concerns can sometimes reflect broader public dissatisfaction, and a 20% threshold strikes a reasonable balance between accessibility and stability.  \n**Impact:** This point is critical because it reframes the debate around the role of minority voices in a democracy and shows that the proposed threshold is a fair compromise.  \n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Prohibiting impeachment as a removal mechanism removes a crucial check on executive power, risking abuse of authority.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The opposition's argument overlooks the fact that impeachment is often a partisan tool rather than a neutral accountability mechanism. For example, the impeachment of Governor Blagojevich in Illinois was driven by bipartisan consensus, but many other impeachment attempts have been politically motivated.  \n- Our proposal does not eliminate accountability but shifts it to a more direct and democratic process. Voter-initiated recalls are less susceptible to partisan manipulation than legislative impeachments.  \n- The opposition's principle assumes that impeachment is the only effective check on executive power, but history shows that it is often ineffective or misused.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is essential because it demonstrates that voter-initiated recalls are a more democratic and less partisan alternative to impeachment.  \n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition may argue that our examples of California and Venezuela are outliers and not representative of the broader impact of recall elections.  \n- They may also claim that a 20% threshold is still too low and could lead to frequent recalls, even if it is higher than some existing systems.  \n- The opposition might emphasize the potential for voter fatigue or apathy in recall elections, reducing their effectiveness as an accountability mechanism.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- We can reinforce our case by citing additional examples, such as the successful recall of Governor Lynn Frazier in North Dakota in 1921, which led to positive governance reforms.  \n- We can also argue that the 20% threshold is a reasonable compromise that has been successfully implemented in other democratic systems, such as Switzerland.  \n- To address concerns about voter fatigue, we can emphasize that the proposed restrictions on recalls during the first and last 6 months of a term prevent excessive use of the mechanism.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our arguments directly challenge the opposition's principles and evidence, showing that recall elections are a necessary and democratic tool for accountability.  \n- We provide a balanced framework that addresses both the need for stability and the importance of direct voter engagement.  \n- Our case is supported by concrete examples and principles that demonstrate the superiority of recall elections over legislative impeachment.  \n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The most important disagreements are the value of stability versus accountability, the fairness of the 20% threshold, and the effectiveness of recall elections compared to impeachment.  \n**Why We Win:**  \n- We win on the principle of accountability, showing that recall elections are a more democratic and less partisan mechanism than impeachment.  \n- We demonstrate that the 20% threshold is a reasonable compromise that balances accessibility and stability.  \n- Our evidence and examples show that recall elections can effectively address governance issues without causing undue disruption.  \n**Overall Impact:**  \n- Winning these key points proves that recall elections through voter petitions are a necessary and effective tool for ensuring democratic accountability, making them superior to the current system of legislative impeachment.  \n\n",
      "closing": "**PROPOSITION CLOSING SPEECH**\n\n**FRAMING**  \nThe core issue in this debate is whether recall elections through voter petitions enhance or undermine democratic accountability and governance stability. This decision hinges on two key questions:  \n1. **Accountability**: Should voters have a direct mechanism to hold governors accountable, or should this power remain with state legislatures?  \n2. **Stability**: Does the recall proposal create unnecessary political instability, or does it strike a balance between stability and democratic responsiveness?  \n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Stability vs. Accountability**  \n*Quote*: \"Recall elections through voter petitions undermine democratic stability by creating constant political uncertainty.\"  \n*Our Case Strength*: Accountability is a cornerstone of democracy, and the proposed recall mechanism empowers voters to directly address governance failures. The opposition\u2019s focus on stability overlooks the fact that instability is often a symptom of governance issues, not the recall mechanism itself. For example, the recall of California\u2019s Governor Gray Davis in 2003 was driven by legitimate public discontent over energy crises and budget mismanagement, not by the process itself.  \n*Their Response Gaps*: The opposition failed to address how legislative impeachment, as the sole removal mechanism, can be weaponized by partisan majorities, undermining democratic principles. Impeachment is often less representative of public will than a recall election, as seen in politically motivated impeachments at the state level.  \n*Crucial Impact*: Winning this clash is critical because it shifts the debate to the value of direct voter empowerment over governance stability, which is central to the motion.  \n\n**Clash 2: The 20% Threshold**  \n*Quote*: \"A 20% voter petition threshold is too low and risks abuse by well-organized minority groups.\"  \n*Our Case Strength*: The 20% threshold is a reasonable compromise that ensures recalls are not frivolous while allowing significant public discontent to be addressed. Compared to California\u2019s 12% threshold, the proposed 20% requirement is significantly higher and reduces the risk of abuse. For example, the recall of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker in 2012, which required 25% of votes from the previous election, was driven by widespread public dissatisfaction rather than a vocal minority.  \n*Their Response Gaps*: The opposition failed to provide evidence that a 20% threshold would lead to frequent or frivolous recalls. Their reliance on California\u2019s 12% threshold is irrelevant given the higher bar in the motion.  \n*Crucial Impact*: Winning this clash demonstrates that the proposed threshold is fair and balanced, addressing concerns about minority abuse while preserving democratic accountability.  \n\n**Clash 3: Timeframe Restrictions**  \n*Quote*: \"Prohibiting removal during the first and last 6 months of a term creates unnecessary rigidity and limits accountability.\"  \n*Our Case Strength*: The timeframe restrictions strike a balance between accountability and stability by preventing premature recalls that could disrupt governance transitions. The first 6 months allow governors to implement their agenda, while the last 6 months prevent election-year interference. For example, the recall of North Dakota Governor Lynn Frazier in 1921 occurred mid-term, allowing voters to address governance issues without destabilizing transitions.  \n*Their Response Gaps*: The opposition failed to address how unrestricted recall periods could lead to constant campaigning and governance paralysis, as governors would be perpetually focused on retaining their position.  \n*Crucial Impact*: Winning this clash shows that the timeframe restrictions are a necessary safeguard to ensure effective governance while preserving accountability.  \n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \nThe key voting issues are:  \n1. **Accountability**: The recall mechanism empowers voters to directly address governance failures, making it more democratic than legislative impeachment.  \n2. **Threshold Fairness**: The 20% threshold is a balanced compromise that prevents frivolous recalls while allowing significant public discontent to be addressed.  \n3. **Timeframe Necessity**: The restrictions on recalls during the first and last 6 months protect governance stability without undermining accountability.  \n\n**Case Proof**: Winning these issues proves that the recall proposal enhances democratic accountability, strikes a fair balance in its design, and protects governance stability.  \n\n**Final Weighing**: Even if the opposition wins on minor points, the overarching case for direct voter empowerment and democratic accountability outweighs any concerns about stability or threshold fairness. The recall mechanism is a necessary and effective tool for ensuring that governors remain responsive to the public will.  \n\n**Vote Proposition**: For a more democratic, accountable, and balanced system of gubernatorial removal.  \n\n"

Recall elections through voter petitions destabilize governance, risk disenfranchising the majority, and remove a critical accountability mechanism. This not only undermines the effectiveness of state leadership but also weakens the democratic principles of stability, majority rule, and checks on power. The practical impact of this motion would be a less effective, more polarized, and potentially abusive governance structure.  \n\n**Confidence Bet Logic**  \n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL STRUCTURE**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Recall elections through voter petitions undermine democratic stability by creating constant political uncertainty.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The principle of democratic accountability is superior to stability in ensuring that elected officials remain responsive to the electorate.  \n- While stability is important, it should not come at the cost of allowing leaders to act without consequence.  \n- Frequent political engagement through recall mechanisms ensures that governors remain aligned with the evolving needs and values of their constituents, fostering a more dynamic and responsive democracy.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial as it shifts the focus from stability to accountability, demonstrating that the proposed mechanism enhances democratic responsiveness rather than undermining it.  \n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"A 20% voter petition threshold is too low and risks abuse by well-organized minority groups.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The evidence from California (12% threshold) does not directly support the claim that a 20% threshold is too low, as the higher threshold significantly reduces the risk of abuse.  \n- The 20% requirement represents a substantial portion of the electorate, ensuring that recalls are driven by significant public concern rather than fringe groups.  \n- Historical examples of recalls under similar thresholds (e.g., Wisconsin 2012) demonstrate that they are typically used for legitimate grievances rather than partisan maneuvering.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point diminishes the concern about minority abuse, reinforcing the legitimacy of the 20% threshold as a safeguard against frivolous recalls.  \n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Prohibiting removal during the first and last 6 months of a term creates unnecessary rigidity and limits accountability.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \n- The principle of protecting a governor from immediate political pressure ensures they have adequate time to implement their agenda without premature disruption.  \n- The final 6 months prohibition prevents election-year interference, ensuring that governors can focus on governance rather than campaigning.  \n- Early accountability can disrupt the necessary transition period, while end-term accountability risks destabilizing the transition to a new administration.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point underscores the necessity of these timeframes to ensure effective governance and smooth transitions, balancing accountability with stability.  \n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- My counter to the stability argument may be critiqued for prioritizing accountability over effective governance.  \n- The evidence critique on the 20% threshold risks being challenged by the assertion that even 20% can be mobilized by well-organized groups.  \n- The defense of the timeframe restrictions may be seen as overly rigid, limiting voters' ability to hold leaders accountable in critical moments.  \n**Additional Support:**  \n- Emphasize the democratic principle that accountability mechanisms must balance responsiveness with stability.  \n- Highlight historical examples where recall mechanisms have successfully addressed legitimate grievances without destabilizing governance.  \n- Argue that the timeframes are reasonable compromises, ensuring both stability and accountability.  \n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- My principles and evidence directly address and refute the proposition\u2019s key claims, demonstrating the superiority of the opposition\u2019s framework.  \n- The balance between accountability and stability, coupled with the legitimacy of the 20% threshold and timeframe restrictions, provides a more compelling case.  \n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- Democratic accountability vs. stability.  \n- Legitimacy of the 20% threshold.  \n- Necessity of timeframe restrictions.  \n**Why We Win:**  \n- Accountability and responsiveness are more critical to democracy than stability.  \n- The 20% threshold ensures recalls are driven by significant public concern.  \n- Timeframe restrictions protect governance continuity without fully undermining accountability.  \n**Overall Impact:** Winning these key points demonstrates the proposed recall mechanism enhances democratic accountability without destabilizing governance, proving the opposition\u2019s case and defeating the proposition.  \n\n**",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**  \n**Core Questions:**  \n- The debate hinges on whether recall elections through voter petitions enhance democratic accountability or undermine governance stability.  \n- The key decisions revolve around the balance between accountability and stability, the legitimacy of the 20% threshold, and the necessity of timeframe restrictions.  \n- The debate should be evaluated based on which side better upholds democratic principles while ensuring effective governance.  \n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: Stability vs. Accountability**  \n**Quote:**  \nProposition: \"Recall elections through voter petitions enhance democratic accountability by ensuring governors remain responsive to the electorate.\"  \nOpposition: \"Recall elections through voter petitions undermine governance stability by creating constant political uncertainty.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The principle of governance stability is essential for effective policy implementation and long-term planning.  \n- Frequent recall elections disrupt governance, leading to short-term populist measures rather than sustainable policies.  \n- Historical examples (California 2003, Venezuela 2004) demonstrate how recalls exacerbate division and political instability.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition prioritizes accountability without adequately addressing the practical consequences of instability.  \n- Their examples (California and Venezuela) highlight the risks of recalls but fail to show consistent benefits.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Stability is foundational to effective governance, and undermining it jeopardizes long-term progress and public trust.  \n\n**Clash 2: Legitimacy of the 20% Threshold**  \n**Quote:**  \nProposition: \"A 20% voter petition threshold ensures recalls are driven by significant public concern, not minority abuse.\"  \nOpposition: \"A 20% threshold is too low and risks disenfranchising the majority, enabling minority-driven recalls.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- A 20% threshold allows well-organized minority groups to impose their will on the majority, undermining democratic principles.  \n- California's 12% threshold has already led to controversial and frequent recalls, and even 20% is insufficient to prevent abuse.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition\u2019s claim that 20% represents a \"substantial portion of the electorate\" is arbitrary and not backed by evidence.  \n- They fail to counter the risk of special interest groups weaponizing the mechanism.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- A low threshold risks eroding trust in democratic institutions by enabling minority-driven disruptions.  \n\n**Clash 3: Necessity of Timeframe Restrictions**  \n**Quote:**  \nProposition: \"Prohibiting recalls during the first and last 6 months of a term creates unnecessary rigidity and limits accountability.\"  \nOpposition: \"Timeframe restrictions ensure governors have adequate time to implement their agenda and prevent election-year interference.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- The first 6 months allow governors to establish their governance framework without premature disruption.  \n- The last 6 months prevent election-year interference, ensuring smooth transitions and continuity.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The proposition cannot demonstrate that the timeframe restrictions create significant gaps in accountability.  \n- Their argument for early accountability risks destabilizing governance during critical transition periods.  \n**Crucial Impact:**  \n- Timeframe restrictions balance accountability with stability, ensuring long-term governance effectiveness.  \n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n- The most critical clash is stability vs. accountability, as it underpins the entire debate.  \n- The legitimacy of the 20% threshold and timeframe restrictions are also essential, as they determine the practical feasibility of the proposal.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Winning the stability vs. accountability clash shows that recall elections undermine governance effectiveness.  \n- Winning the threshold and timeframe clashes demonstrates that the proposed mechanism is prone to abuse and lacks necessary safeguards.  \n- These points together prove that the current system of legislative impeachment is a more balanced and effective mechanism.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \n- While the proposition emphasizes accountability, our case shows that their proposal risks destabilizing governance, enabling minority abuse, and creating accountability gaps.  \n- The opposition\u2019s framework ensures both stability and accountability, making it the superior choice.  \n\n"

The opposition\u2019s reliance on the stability principle was critiqued through the lens of democratic accountability, and their evidence on the threshold was rendered irrelevant by the higher bar in the motion.
