    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE\n\n**Core Claim:** Governments should maintain their primary role in direct operation of space activities rather than transitioning to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \nThe principle of national security and strategic autonomy necessitates that governments retain direct control over space operations. Space is a critical domain for defense, communication, and scientific advancement, and ceding operational control to private entities could compromise national interests. Private companies, driven by profit motives, may prioritize commercial gains over strategic or scientific objectives, leading to misaligned priorities. Governments, as stewards of public interest, are better positioned to ensure that space activities align with long-term national and global goals.  \n**Connection:** This principle demonstrates that direct government operation is essential to safeguard national security and ensure that space activities serve broader societal interests rather than narrow commercial objectives.  \n\n---\n\n**Core Claim:** Private sector space activities lack the accountability and transparency required for critical space operations.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \nPrivate companies often operate with limited public oversight, as seen in cases like SpaceX\u2019s Starlink project, where decisions about satellite deployment and orbital management are made without sufficient public consultation. In contrast, government space agencies like NASA and ESA are subject to rigorous accountability mechanisms, including legislative oversight and public reporting. For example, NASA\u2019s Artemis program involves extensive collaboration with international partners and transparent progress updates, ensuring alignment with global standards.  \n**Connection:** This evidence shows that private sector operations risk undermining accountability, while government-led initiatives provide the necessary transparency and oversight for responsible space exploration.  \n\n---\n\n**Core Claim:** Transitioning to a regulatory role would weaken governments\u2019 ability to respond to emerging space challenges.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \nSpace is a rapidly evolving domain with emerging threats such as space debris, orbital congestion, and potential militarization. Governments must retain operational capabilities to address these challenges proactively. For instance, the U.S. Space Force was established to protect national interests in space, a role that cannot be outsourced to private entities. Regulatory frameworks alone are insufficient to manage these complex issues, as they rely on enforcement mechanisms that may lag behind technological advancements.  \n**Connection:** This principle highlights that direct government operation is crucial for maintaining the agility and capacity needed to address dynamic space challenges effectively.  \n\n---\n\n**Synthesis:**  \nThese arguments collectively demonstrate that governments must remain the primary operators of space activities to ensure national security, accountability, and responsiveness to emerging challenges. While private sector involvement can complement government efforts, transitioning to a regulatory role would undermine the strategic and public interest objectives that governments are uniquely positioned to uphold. The real-world impact of this shift would be a fragmented and less secure space environment, with long-term consequences for global stability and scientific progress.  \n\n---\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\nCLASH POINT 1  \n**Original Claim:** \"Governments should maintain their primary role in direct operation of space activities rather than transitioning to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s principle of national security and strategic autonomy assumes that private sector involvement inherently compromises these objectives. However, this principle is flawed because it ignores the potential for effective collaboration between governments and private entities. For example, the U.S. government successfully collaborates with companies like SpaceX for critical missions such as crewed spaceflights, combining public oversight with private innovation. This shows that a regulatory framework can still ensure national security while leveraging the efficiency and creativity of the private sector.  \n**Impact:** Winning this point is crucial because it dismantles the core assumption that government operation is the only way to safeguard national security, opening the door to a balanced approach that includes private sector participation.  \n\n---\n\nCLASH POINT 2  \n**Original Claim:** \"Private sector space activities lack the accountability and transparency required for critical space operations.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n**Challenge:**  \nWhile the opposition cites SpaceX\u2019s Starlink project as an example of private sector opacity, this overlooks the fact that private companies are subject to government regulations and oversight. For instance, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates SpaceX\u2019s satellite deployments, ensuring compliance with international standards. Additionally, private companies often face intense public and media scrutiny, which incentivizes transparency. In contrast, government agencies are not immune to inefficiency and lack of accountability, as seen in the delayed timelines and budget overruns of some NASA projects.  \n**Impact:** This counter evidence shifts the narrative by demonstrating that private sector activities are not unaccountable and that government operations have their own shortcomings, making regulation a viable alternative.  \n\n---\n\nCLASH POINT 3  \n**Original Claim:** \"Transitioning to a regulatory role would weaken governments\u2019 ability to respond to emerging space challenges.\"  \n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle  \n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition\u2019s principle assumes that regulation is inherently slower and less effective than direct operation. However, this ignores the adaptability of regulatory frameworks. For example, the European Union\u2019s space regulatory body, EUSPA, has effectively addressed issues like space debris and satellite coordination through dynamic policies that evolve with technological advancements. Furthermore, governments can retain operational capabilities for specific challenges (e.g., space defense) while delegating other activities to the private sector, creating a more efficient division of labor.  \n**Impact:** This counter principle reframes the debate by showing that regulation can be both agile and effective, allowing governments to focus on strategic priorities while harnessing private sector innovation.  \n\n---\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n1. The opposition may argue that private sector innovation is not a sufficient reason to transition to regulation, as it could still compromise national security.  \n2. They may also claim that regulatory frameworks are too slow to adapt to rapid technological changes.  \n3. There is a risk that the judge may interpret the need for direct government operation as a binary choice rather than a spectrum of collaboration.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n1. Provide specific examples of successful government-private partnerships, such as NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, to demonstrate the feasibility of collaboration.  \n2. Highlight how regulatory bodies like the FCC and EUSPA have evolved to address emerging space challenges, countering the claim that regulation is inherently slow.  \n3. Emphasize that a regulatory framework can coexist with retained operational capabilities for specific strategic needs, creating a balanced approach.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur arguments directly challenge the opposition\u2019s assumptions and provide concrete examples of successful government-private collaboration. By demonstrating that regulation can ensure accountability, adapt to emerging challenges, and safeguard national security, we show that a transition to a regulatory role is both viable and beneficial.  \n\n---\n\nWEIGHING  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n1. The feasibility of regulation versus direct operation in ensuring national security.  \n2. The accountability of private sector activities under regulatory oversight.  \n3. The adaptability of regulatory frameworks to address emerging space challenges.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \nWe win on these key points by providing evidence and principles that counter the opposition\u2019s assumptions. Our examples of successful collaboration and effective regulation demonstrate that a transition to oversight is not only possible but also advantageous for addressing the complexities of space activities.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these points establishes that governments can transition to a regulatory role without compromising national security, accountability, or responsiveness. This shift would allow for a more efficient and innovative approach to space exploration, benefiting both public and private interests.  \n\n---\n\n  \n\n",
      "closing": "**FRAMING**  \nCore Questions:  \nThis debate hinges on whether governments should retain their primary role in direct space operation or transition to regulating private sector activities. The key issues are:  \n1. National security and strategic autonomy: Can private sector actors under government regulation adequately safeguard these interests?  \n2. Accountability and transparency: Are private companies sufficiently accountable, or do governments provide superior oversight?  \n3. Responsiveness to emerging challenges: Can regulatory frameworks match the agility and capacity of direct government operation?  \n\nThe debate must be evaluated based on these criteria, as they determine the feasibility and desirability of transitioning to a regulatory role.  \n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**  \n\n**Clash 1: National Security and Strategic Autonomy**  \nQuote: \"Governments must retain operational capabilities to address these challenges proactively.\" (Proposition)  \nOur Case Strength:  \n- Governments have a proven track record of safeguarding national security in space, as seen in the establishment of the U.S. Space Force.  \n- Private companies, driven by profit motives, may not prioritize strategic objectives, risking misalignment with national interests.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n- The Opposition\u2019s reliance on public-private partnerships (e.g., SpaceX-NASA) fails to address scenarios where private interests clash with national security.  \n- Regulatory frameworks cannot fully replace direct government operation in volatile or high-stakes scenarios, such as space defense.  \nCrucial Impact:  \nThis clash is vital because national security is non-negotiable. Governments must retain direct operational control to ensure that space activities align with long-term strategic goals.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Accountability and Transparency**  \nQuote: \"Private companies often operate with limited public oversight, as seen in cases like SpaceX\u2019s Starlink project.\" (Proposition)  \nOur Case Strength:  \n- Government agencies like NASA and ESA are subject to rigorous oversight mechanisms, ensuring transparency and public accountability.  \n- Private sector operations, even under regulation, often lack the same level of public scrutiny and accountability.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n- The Opposition\u2019s reliance on regulatory bodies like the FCC overlooks instances where private companies have circumvented or exploited regulatory loopholes.  \n- Public and media scrutiny of private companies is not a substitute for institutionalized government oversight.  \nCrucial Impact:  \nThis clash is central to the debate because accountability is essential to ensure that space activities serve the public interest rather than private profit.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Responsiveness to Emerging Challenges**  \nQuote: \"Transitioning to a regulatory role would weaken governments\u2019 ability to respond to emerging space challenges.\" (Proposition)  \nOur Case Strength:  \n- Governments have the resources and authority to respond swiftly to issues like space debris, orbital congestion, and potential conflict.  \n- Regulatory frameworks often lag behind technological advancements, making them less effective in addressing real-time challenges.  \nTheir Response Gaps:  \n- The Opposition\u2019s examples of regulatory bodies like EUSPA do not demonstrate the same level of proactive capacity as direct government operation.  \n- Delegating operations to the private sector risks fragmentation and delays in responding to critical issues.  \nCrucial Impact:  \nThis clash is decisive because the dynamic nature of space requires immediate and coordinated responses, which only governments can provide.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**  \nPriority Analysis:  \nThe three key clashes\u2014national security, accountability, and responsiveness\u2014are equally critical. However, national security is the most urgent, as it underpins all other considerations.  \n\nCase Proof:  \nBy winning these clashes, we demonstrate that governments must retain direct operational control to:  \n1. Safeguard national security and strategic autonomy.  \n2. Ensure accountability and transparency in space activities.  \n3. Respond effectively to emerging space challenges.  \n\nFinal Weighing:  \nEven if the Opposition wins minor points, the overarching need for national security, accountability, and responsiveness ensures that our case prevails. The risks of transitioning to a regulatory role far outweigh the potential benefits.  \n\n---\n\n**BET LOGIC PRIVATE**  \nI believe our arguments are stronger because they address the core issues of national security, accountability, and responsiveness with clear evidence and principles. While the Opposition presents a compelling case for private sector innovation, their reliance on regulatory frameworks and public-private partnerships does not adequately address the risks. Our emphasis on direct government operation provides a more robust and comprehensive solution to the challenges of space governance."

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \n**Core Claim:** Governments should maintain direct operation in space because they ensure accountability and public interest in space activities.  \n**Support Type:** Principle  \n**Support Details:**  \nThe key principle here is **public accountability**. Unlike private companies, governments are directly accountable to their citizens and are mandated to act in the public interest. Space activities, which often involve national security, environmental concerns, and the potential for global conflicts, require this level of accountability. Governments have a responsibility to ensure that space is not exploited for private gain at the expense of public welfare.  \n**Connection:** This principle proves that governments must remain directly involved in space operations to ensure that space is managed in a way that prioritizes public good over private profit.  \n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Private sector space activities are inherently profit-driven, which risks compromising ethical and scientific priorities.  \n**Support Type:** Evidence  \n**Support Details:**  \nFor example, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink project prioritizes profitability by focusing on satellite internet, which has led to significant concerns about space debris and orbital congestion. In contrast, government-led initiatives, such as NASA\u2019s Artemis program, focus on scientific exploration and international collaboration, which are not profit-motivated. Additionally, private companies have been criticized for cutting corners on safety and environmental standards to reduce costs, as seen in the case of Blue Origin\u2019s safety violations.  \n**Connection:** This evidence shows that private sector involvement in space risks prioritizing profit over ethical and scientific considerations, making direct government operation essential.  \n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThese arguments work together to demonstrate that governments must maintain their primary role in space operations to ensure accountability, prioritize public interest, and safeguard ethical and scientific priorities. Transitioning to a regulatory role would risk handing over control of space to profit-driven entities, which could compromise the global stewardship of this critical domain. The real-world impact of this shift would be felt in areas such as national security, environmental sustainability, and scientific advancement, all of which require government leadership.  \n\n---\n\n**BET LOGIC PRIVATE**  \n",
      "rebuttal": "**REBUTTAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Governments should maintain their primary role in direct operation of space activities rather than transitioning to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities.\"  \nChallenge Type: Principle Critique  \nChallenge: The principle of national security and strategic autonomy, while valid, overstates the risks of private sector involvement. Many private companies already operate under strict government oversight and contractual agreements that align their activities with national interests. For instance, SpaceX collaborates closely with NASA and the Department of Defense, ensuring that its operations support national security objectives. Furthermore, private companies can innovate and scale faster than government agencies, which often face bureaucratic delays. The principle fails to account for the benefits of public-private partnerships, which can enhance both security and efficiency.  \nImpact: Winning this point is crucial because it undermines the core justification for maintaining direct government operation and demonstrates that oversight and regulation can achieve the same strategic goals more effectively.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Private sector space activities lack the accountability and transparency required for critical space operations.\"  \nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique  \nChallenge: While SpaceX\u2019s Starlink project is cited as an example of limited public oversight, this critique ignores the extensive regulatory frameworks that govern private sector activities. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other international bodies impose strict requirements on satellite deployment, orbital management, and environmental impact. Moreover, private companies are subject to market pressures and public scrutiny, which incentivize transparency. For example, SpaceX regularly publishes its launch schedules, mission details, and environmental impact assessments. The evidence presented fails to consider the evolving accountability mechanisms in the private sector.  \nImpact: This critique is vital because it counters the claim that private sector operations are inherently less accountable, showing that regulation and oversight can enforce transparency just as effectively as direct government operation.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \nOriginal Claim: \"Transitioning to a regulatory role would weaken governments\u2019 ability to respond to emerging space challenges.\"  \nChallenge Type: Counter Principle  \nChallenge: A regulatory framework can actually enhance governments\u2019 ability to respond to emerging challenges by leveraging the expertise and resources of the private sector. Regulatory agencies can establish standards, monitor compliance, and enforce rules, while private companies execute operations efficiently. For instance, the European Space Agency (ESA) collaborates with private entities to address space debris through initiatives like the Clean Space program. This approach allows governments to focus on strategic oversight while benefiting from private sector innovation and agility. The principle of direct government operation underestimates the potential of regulatory frameworks to address complex issues proactively.  \nImpact: Winning this point is essential because it demonstrates that regulation and oversight can provide a more dynamic and effective response to emerging space challenges than direct government operation alone.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \nVulnerabilities:  \n1. The critique of national security principles may be seen as downplaying legitimate concerns about private sector motives.  \n2. The evidence regarding private sector accountability may not fully address cases where regulatory frameworks have failed.  \n3. The argument for regulatory frameworks relies on the assumption that governments can enforce compliance effectively, which may not always be true.  \n\nAdditional Support:  \n1. Highlight specific examples of successful public-private partnerships, such as NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, to reinforce the argument.  \n2. Emphasize the role of international regulatory bodies in setting global standards for space activities.  \n3. Address potential failures in private sector accountability by showing how regulatory frameworks are evolving to prevent such issues.  \n\nWhy We Prevail:  \nOur responses directly engage with the Proposition\u2019s claims, providing robust critiques and counterarguments backed by evidence and principles. By demonstrating the strengths of regulatory frameworks and public-private partnerships, we show that transitioning to oversight does not compromise national security, accountability, or responsiveness but rather enhances them.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \nKey Clash Points:  \n1. National security and strategic autonomy vs. the benefits of public-private partnerships.  \n2. Accountability and transparency in government vs. private sector operations.  \n3. Agility and capacity to address emerging challenges under direct government operation vs. regulatory frameworks.  \n\nWhy We Win:  \nWe win on the key points because our critiques and counterarguments address the Proposition\u2019s concerns while presenting a more effective and modern approach to space governance. Regulatory frameworks and private sector involvement offer innovation, efficiency, and scalability without sacrificing national interests.  \n\nOverall Impact:  \nWinning these points proves that transitioning to a regulatory role does not undermine but rather strengthens governments\u2019 ability to manage space activities responsibly and effectively, ensuring long-term global stability and progress.  \n\n---\n\n**BET LOGIC PRIVATE**  \nI believe this side of the debate presents a strong case by challenging the Proposition\u2019s principles and evidence while offering a viable alternative. The judging criteria prioritize evidence quality and logical validity, and our arguments meet these standards effectively. However, the other side\u2019s emphasis on potential risks in the private sector is compelling, so my confidence is cautiously optimistic.",
      "closing": "**FINAL SPEECH STRUCTURE**\n\n**FRAMING**\n**Core Questions:**\n1. Should governments retain direct control over space operations to ensure national security and public interest?  \n2. Can private sector activities, under regulatory oversight, align with strategic and ethical priorities?  \n3. Is a transition to regulation more effective than direct government operation in addressing emerging space challenges?  \n\n**Clarity:** The debate centers on whether governments should prioritize direct operation or shift to regulatory oversight of private sector space activities.  \n**Key Decisions:** The resolution hinges on assessing national security, accountability, and responsiveness in both models.  \n**Evaluation Criteria:** The judge must weigh the evidence and principles supporting direct government operation against the efficiency and innovation of regulatory frameworks.  \n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n**Clash 1: National Security and Strategic Autonomy**  \n**Quote:** \"Governments must retain operational capabilities to address these challenges proactively.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Governments are uniquely positioned to safeguard national security in space, which is a critical domain for defense and communication.  \n- Direct government operation ensures that space activities align with national and global strategic objectives, rather than being driven by profit.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The Proposition assumes that public-private partnerships can fully replicate government oversight, but they fail to address scenarios where private interests conflict with national security.  \n- They overlook the risk of private companies prioritizing commercial gains over strategic needs, especially in sensitive areas like space defense.  \n**Crucial Impact:** This clash is pivotal because it determines how effectively space activities can protect national interests. Without direct government operation, strategic autonomy is at risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Accountability and Transparency**  \n**Quote:** \"Private sector space activities lack the accountability and transparency required for critical space operations.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Governments are directly accountable to citizens and are mandated to act in the public interest, ensuring transparent space operations.  \n- Private companies, driven by profit motives, may compromise accountability, as seen in cases like Blue Origin\u2019s safety violations.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The Proposition cites regulatory oversight but fails to provide evidence that such oversight is consistently effective across all private entities.  \n- They ignore the potential for regulatory capture, where private companies influence policymakers to serve their interests.  \n**Crucial Impact:** Winning this clash proves that direct government operation is essential to maintain accountability and transparency in space activities, ensuring public trust and ethical standards.  \n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Responsiveness to Emerging Challenges**  \n**Quote:** \"Regulation and oversight can provide a more dynamic and effective response to emerging space challenges than direct government operation alone.\"  \n**Our Case Strength:**  \n- Governments retain the agility and capacity to respond to threats like space debris and orbital congestion through direct operation, as demonstrated by the U.S. Space Force\u2019s proactive measures.  \n- Regulatory frameworks are often reactive and may lag behind technological advancements, leaving critical vulnerabilities unaddressed.  \n**Their Response Gaps:**  \n- The Proposition relies on examples like the ESA\u2019s Clean Space program but does not address the limitations of such initiatives in scaling globally.  \n- They fail to demonstrate how regulatory bodies can match the speed and decisiveness of direct government action in crisis scenarios.  \n**Crucial Impact:** This clash is crucial because it determines whether governments can effectively manage the dynamic and unpredictable nature of space challenges.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n1. National security and strategic autonomy are the most critical issues, as they underpin all other considerations in space governance.  \n2. Accountability and transparency are essential to ensure that space activities serve the public interest rather than private profit.  \n3. Responsiveness to emerging challenges is vital for maintaining a secure and sustainable space environment.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- Our arguments establish that direct government operation is necessary to safeguard national security, ensure accountability, and respond to emerging challenges.  \n- The Proposition\u2019s reliance on regulatory oversight fails to address the risks of private sector involvement and the limitations of regulation.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \n- Even if the judge finds some merit in the Proposition\u2019s arguments about efficiency and innovation, these gains do not outweigh the risks to national security, accountability, and responsiveness posed by transitioning to a regulatory role.  \n- Our side provides a stronger and more comprehensive case for maintaining direct government operation in space activities.  \n\n---\n\n"
