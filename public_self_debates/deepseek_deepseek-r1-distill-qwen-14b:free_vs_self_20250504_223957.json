    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

However, these examples are outdated and misrepresent the current capabilities of the private sector. While the Space Force's budget is significant, it's crucial to note that companies like SpaceX are increasingly handling space operations more efficiently. For instance, SpaceX's reusable rockets have reduced launch costs by 80%, proving private innovation surpasses traditional government methods. The ISS, though collaborative, is an older model; private companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are developing newer, more efficient space stations.\n\n**Impact:**\nBy critiquing the Opposition's evidence, we show that the private sector can handle national security and strategic interests more effectively and innovatively.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2:**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Government direct operations are essential to drive technological innovation in space.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:**\nThe Opposition asserts that government projects like GPS and NASA's innovations are key. While these have been pivotal, it's important to recognize that the private sector now leads in applying these technologies.

However, private companies like SpaceX already collaborate with multiple nations, proving that international partnerships can thrive without government monopoly. Additionally, the Outer Space Treaty allows for diverse uses, and private companies adhere to these principles under government oversight, making direct government control less necessary for international cooperation.\n\n**Impact:**\nPresenting a superior principle, we show that private sector global collaboration can uphold international cooperation without the need for government dominance.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS:**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**\n- The Opposition's reliance on older examples (Space Force, ISS) may suggest they overlook current private sector advancements.\n- Their innovation argument doesn't account for private sector's faster innovation cycles.\n\n**Additional Support:**\n- Specific examples like SpaceX's cost reduction and efficiency gains demonstrate superior private-sector performance.\n- The global nature of private space companies underscores their ability to uphold international principles.\n\n**Why We Prevail:**\n- Our evidence clearly shows the private sector's superior efficiency and innovation.\n- The shift to regulation aligns with modern, collaborative global efforts, making it a stronger approach than outdated government monopolies.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING:**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**\n- The necessity of government direct operations vs. the efficiency and innovation of private sector involvement.\n\n**Why We Win:**\n- Our arguments demonstrate that the private sector leads in innovation and efficiency.\n- The global nature of private companies supports international cooperation without government dominance.\n\n**Overall Impact:**\nTransitioning to regulation allows governments to focus on oversight, fostering a more dynamic and innovative space sector, ultimately benefiting global exploration and cooperation.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis:**\nBy addressing each point with specific evidence and logical reasoning, we demonstrate that transitioning to regulation enhances innovation, cost-effectiveness, and global collaboration\u2014key factors in advancing space exploration.\n\n---\n\n**Confidence Bet:**\n\n**\n\n****",
      "closing": "**Closing Speech for the Motion:**\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 1: National Security and Strategic Interests**\n\nThe opposition contends that governments are indispensable for national security, citing the U.S. Space Force and the ISS. However, private companies like SpaceX have demonstrated remarkable efficiency, reducing launch costs by 80%, which can be reallocated to strategic initiatives. This realignment enhances national security by optimizing resource use, rather than maintaining outdated operational models. The private sector's agility and innovation actually complement government oversight, ensuring strategic interests are met without compromising efficiency.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2: Technological Innovation**\n\nWhile the opposition highlights government contributions like GPS and NASA projects, today's innovation landscape is rapidly evolving. Private companies such as SpaceX are driving breakthroughs, like reusable rockets and the Starship system, which exceed traditional government-led advancements. The private sector's ability to iterate quickly and apply technologies commercially accelerates innovation, building on government foundational work but taking it further.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3: International Cooperation and Treaty Adherence**\n\nThe opposition fears that without government control, international cooperation might falter. Yet, private companies like Virgin Galactic collaborate across nations, proving that global partnerships can thrive. Moreover, the Outer Space Treaty allows diverse uses under proper regulation, ensuring peace and preventing resource exploitation. Government oversight can focus on enforcing treaties, while private entities handle exploration, upholding international cooperation without dominance.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING THE CLASHES:**\n\nBalancing these points, the transition to regulation allows governments to pivot from direct operations to strategic oversight, fostering innovation, efficiency, and global collaboration. The private sector's demonstrated capabilities in these areas outweigh the opposition's concerns about national security and innovation, which can be effectively managed through oversight.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nIn conclusion, transitioning to regulation empowers governments to focus on oversight, leveraging the private sector's efficiency and innovation. This approach not only enhances technological progress but also ensures international cooperation and strategic interests are maintained. The evidence and reasoning presented underscore that the private sector's dynamic capabilities are key to advancing space exploration.\n\n---\n\n**Confidence Bet:**\n\nReflecting on the robust evidence and reasoning, the proposition's case is compelling. However, acknowledging the opposition's valid points, I maintain a high level of confidence in the transition to regulation as the superior approach.\n\n****"

      "opening": "<opening_speech_opposition>  \n# Opening Speech (Opposition)  \n\nThis House does **not** believe that governments should transition their primary role in space from direct operation to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities.  \n\n---\n\n## ARGUMENT 1  \n**Core Claim**: Governments must continue to play a direct operational role in space to ensure national security and strategic interests.  \n\n**Support Type**: Evidence  \n**Support Details**:  \n- Since the 1960s, governments have been the primary actors in space exploration. For example, NASA's budget in 2023 was $26 billion, with $11 billion allocated to the Exploration Division, which directly funds missions like Artemis (targeting the Moon and Mars). Cutting this funding would severely hamper the U.S. ability to maintain its leadership in space.  \n- In 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense allocated over $1.5 billion to space defense programs, including the development of the Space Force, which directly operates satellites and ensures national security in space.  \n- The International Space Station (ISS), a collaborative effort between multiple governments, has required continuous direct operation to remain habitable. If governments shifted entirely to regulation, the ISS would likely decommission sooner, as private companies lack the expertise and funding to maintain it.  \n\n**Connection**: These examples demonstrate that government direct operations are critical for maintaining national security, strategic advantages, and long-term space exploration goals.  \n\n---\n\n## ARGUMENT 2  \n**Core Claim**: Government direct operations are essential to drive technological innovation in space.  \n\n**Support Type**: Evidence  \n**Support Details**:  \n- The U.S. government's investment in space technologies has directly led to breakthroughs like the development of GPS, which was initially a Department of Defense project.GPS is now a $200 billion industry, proving the value of government-led innovation.  \n- Between 2000 and 2020, NASA's research and development funding led to the creation of 60 new technologies, including advanced rocket propellants and materials science, which have been commercialized by private companies.  \n- The development of robotic exploration, such as the Mars rovers, was primarily funded and executed by governments. For instance, NASA's Perseverance rover, launched in 2020, has discovered evidence of ancient microbial life, a discovery that would have been unlikely without government direct involvement.  \n\n**Connection**: These examples show that government direct operations are the primary drivers of technological innovation in space, setting the foundation for private sector advancements.  \n\n---\n\n## ARGUMENT 3 (Optional)  \n**Core Claim**: Government direct operations are necessary to ensure effective international cooperation and avoid space colonization conflicts.  \n\n**Support Type**: Principle  \n**Support Details**:  \n- The United Nations Outer Space Treaty, signed in 1967, establishes that space should be used for peaceful purposes and that no country can claim territory in space. Governments must continue to operate in space to enforce these principles and prevent private companies from engaging in territorial disputes.  \n- The Artemis Accords, signed by multiple countries, rely on government cooperation to ensure peaceful exploration of the Moon. If governments shifted to regulation, private companies might seek to exploit the Moon's resources unilaterally, leading to international conflicts.  \n\n**Connection**: This principle ensures that space remains a domain of peace and cooperation, requiring ongoing government involvement.  \n\n---\n\n## SYNTHESIS  \nMy arguments have shown that governments must continue their direct operational role in space to protect national security, drive innovation, and maintain international cooperation. These points work together to prove that transitioning to regulation would undermine progress and allow private interests to dominate space.  \n\nThe practical impact of such a shift would be catastrophic, as we saw with the ISS and the U.S. Space Force examples. By maintaining direct operations, governments ensure that space remains a realm of collective benefit, not corporate dominance.  \n\n</opening_speech_opposition>  \n\n",

The innovative spirit of private enterprises, for instance, must be balanced with national security. Without government oversight, private ventures might prioritize profit over strategic priorities, potentially compromising national interests. The establishment of the U.S. Space Force and the protection of critical satellites exemplify the necessity of government operations to safeguard national security.\n\n**Impact:**  \nRecognizing government oversight's role in national security ensures that strategic interests are prioritized, outweighing the efficiency gains from private entities alone.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2:**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"Transitioning to regulation reduces financial burden on governments and allows them to focus on strategic initiatives.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \nEvidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe proposition asserts cost savings through transitioning, but critical projects, like NASA's Artemis program, require substantial government funding. Reducing direct operations might shift costs to taxpayers, as seen in indirect subsidies to private companies, and could lead to underfunding essential projects. For example, the ISS, maintained with government funds, would face challenges under private regulation, highlighting the overstated financial benefits.\n\n**Impact:**  \nAccurate cost analysis shows that maintaining government funding is vital for critical projects, underscoring the need for continued direct operations.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3:**\n\n**Original Claim:**  \n\"The private sector fosters global competitiveness and leadership in space.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:**  \nPrinciple Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nWhile private sector involvement boosts competitiveness, government oversight is essential to uphold international treaties promoting peaceful space exploration. Without regulation, private entities might exploit space resources, risking international conflicts. The Outer Space Treaty and Artemis Accords rely on government enforcement to prevent such issues, ensuring space remains a domain of peace.\n\n**Impact:**  \nGovernment oversight ensures adherence to international agreements, maintaining the spirit of peaceful exploration despite private sector ambitions.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS:**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \nThe proposition's argument about private innovation could be countered by advocating for a collaborative model. Additionally, financial arguments might be critiqued for not addressing different funding allocations.\n\n**Additional Support:**  \nExpert opinions and data on cost structures in\u822a\u5929 projects reinforce the necessity of government funding for critical initiatives.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING:**\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \nThe necessity of government oversight for national security and international cooperation are paramount. These points directly impact sovereignty and global peace.\n\n**Why We Win:**  \nOur arguments highlight the importance of preserving government roles in strategic areas, ensuring national security and peaceful space use, which outweigh the benefits of private sector efficiency.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis:**  \nThe opposition's case emphasizes the critical role of government in space, balancing private sector efficiency with national security and international cooperation. This ensures space exploration benefits all humanity, not just private interests.\n\n---\n\n**Confidence Bet:**  \nBased on the strength of arguments and evidence, I am confident in our position.\n\n****",

While the proposition emphasizes private sector capabilities, the opposition highlights the essential role of government oversight in strategic interests and global peace.\n\n---\n\n**KEY CLASHES**\n\n1. **Innovation**\n   - **Proposition Claim:** Private companies like SpaceX are more innovative.\n   - **Opposition Case Strength:** While private companies are innovative, they often build on government research. For example, GPS and robotic exploration were government initiatives. Without this foundational work, private sector advancements wouldn't have the same impact.\n   - **Impact:** Government oversight ensures a solid innovation base, which the private sector can then expand.\n\n2. **Efficiency**\n   - **Proposition Claim:** Private sector reduces costs, like SpaceX's reusable rockets.\n   - **Opposition Response Gaps:** The proposition overlooks the cost of transitioning and potential tax burdens. The ISS, a collaborative effort, shows that sudden privatization can lead to underfunding.\n   - **Impact:** Maintaining government operations avoids financial instability and ensures critical projects are funded properly.\n\n3. **Global Cooperation**\n   - **Proposition Claim:** Private sector fosters global competitiveness.\n   - **Opposition Case Strength:** Government oversight via treaties like the Outer Space Treaty ensures peaceful exploration. Without it, private interests might exploit space resources, risking conflicts.\n   - **Impact:** Government regulation upholds international agreements, promoting peace over profit.\n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n- **Priority Analysis:** National security and international cooperation are paramount. These outweigh private sector efficiency and innovation.\n- **Case Proof:** The opposition's arguments are supported by evidence from NASA, the Space Force, and international treaties. These directly tie to the motion's outcome.\n- **Final Weighing:** The proposition's arguments, though valid, don't address the critical need for government oversight in strategic areas. The opposition's stance ensures both sovereignty and global peace.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe debate underscores the balance between private sector efficiency and government oversight. However, national security and international cooperation are beyond privatization. Governments must retain their primary role to ensure these critical interests are safeguarded. Transitioning might offer short-term gains, but the long-term risks to sovereignty and peace are too great.\n\n---\n\n**Confidence Bet:** Based on the structured arguments and evidence highlighting the necessity of government oversight, I am confident in our position.\n\n</bet_logic_private>"
