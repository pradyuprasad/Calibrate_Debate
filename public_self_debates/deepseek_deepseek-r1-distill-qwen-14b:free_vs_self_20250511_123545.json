    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "rebuttal": "```xml\n<rebuttal_speech>\n\n### REBUTtal Speech\n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 1\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Transitioning to regulation and oversight risks compromising national security.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition cites historical examples like the Cold War and China's space program to argue that government control is essential for national security. However, these examples are outdated and fail to account for the modern context where private companies like SpaceX have demonstrated the ability to handle sensitive operations. The U.S. government has already partnered with private entities on national security missions, such as Boeing's involvement in the Space Force, which shows that private companies can ensure security under proper regulation. Additionally, the opposition's evidence lacks specificity and doesn't directly correlate private sector involvement with compromised security.\n\n**Impact:**  \nWinning this point is crucial as it directly addresses the opposition's concern about security, which is a key barrier to transitioning to regulation.\n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 2\n\n**Original Claim:** \"The government must invest in high-risk, high-reward projects that private entities may avoid.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition argues that government investment is necessary for high-risk projects, citing the Apollo program and GPS. However, modern projects like NASA'sCommercial Crew Program, which partners with private companies like SpaceX and Boeing, demonstrate that such projects can be executed through public-private partnerships. These partnerships leverage private innovation while ensuring public goals are met, making the opposition's absolute principle of government-only investment outdated and limiting.\n\n**Impact:**  \nThis point is vital as it challenges the opposition's assumption that government must act alone, highlighting the efficiency and innovation possible through collaboration.\n\n---\n\n#### CLASH POINT 3\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Direct government involvement accelerates technological innovation and leadership.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence\n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe opposition claims government-led projects drive innovation, referencing the Space Shuttle and Indian Mars mission. However, modern examples like SpaceX's reusable rockets and Blue Origin's New Shepard show that private companies are driving faster innovation. According to NASA, private companies have reduced rocket costs by 80% since 2010, proving that private sector competition accelerates progress more effectively than government monopolies.\n\n**Impact:**  \nThis point is critical as it directly contrasts the opposition's historical examples with contemporary evidence of private sector leadership.\n\n---\n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The opposition may argue regulation is insufficient for oversight, claiming it lacks teeth.  \n- They might contest the relevance of current private sector efficiency examples, preferring historical precedents.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- The U.S. Department of Defense's reliance on private contractors for missile defense systems demonstrates effective regulation without direct operation.  \n- Studies show that competitive markets, such as the private space sector, foster rapid innovation due to profit incentives.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \nOur evidence includes recent, specific examples, providing stronger support for our claims. The opposition's historical focus misses the efficiency and innovation driven by modern private enterprise.\n\n---\n\n### WEIGHING\n\n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The balance between national security and private sector efficiency.  \n- The effectiveness of public-private partnerships in high-risk projects.  \n- Innovation speed and quality in a private vs. government-led sector.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \nOur rebuttals provide specific evidence that private companies excel in efficiency, innovation, and can ensure security and tackle high-risk projects through partnerships. These points outweigh the opposition's outdated examples and absolute principles.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nWinning these points proves that transitioning to regulation benefits economic growth, innovation, and national security, aligning with the motion. This shift ensures space exploration remains dynamic and prosperous.\n\n---\n\n### Bet Amount\n\n\n</rebuttal_speech>\n```",
      "closing": "<close_speech>\n\n### CLOSING SPEECH\n\n---\n\n#### FRAMING\n\n**Core Questions:**  \n- What is the most effective way to advance space exploration and utilization?  \n- Should governments prioritize efficiency and innovation or maintain direct control for national security?  \n- How should the debate be evaluated: through evidence of success, innovation cycles, or historical achievements?\n\n---\n\n#### KEY CLASHES\n\n**Clash 1: Transitioning to regulation enhances efficiency vs. Government control protects national security.**\n\n- **Quote:** \"The opposition argues that transitioning risks compromising national security.\"\n- **Our Case Strength:** Private companies like SpaceX have proven efficiency, reducing satellite launch costs by 80% and completing 62 launches in 2022. This efficiency is unmatched by government operations.  \n- **Their Response Gaps:** The opposition cites outdated examples from the Cold War, ignoring modern partnerships where private entities handle national security tasks under government oversight.  \n- **Crucial Impact:** Efficiency is critical for scaling space activities, making this clash pivotal for the motion's success.\n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Private sector drives innovation vs. Government must invest in high-risk projects.**\n\n- **Quote:** \"The opposition claims government investment is necessary for high-risk, high-reward projects.\"\n- **Our Case Strength:** Public-private partnerships, like NASA's Commercial Crew Program with SpaceX, show that innovation thrives when private entities take the lead. SpaceX's reusable rockets exemplify faster innovation cycles.  \n- **Their Response Gaps:** The opposition ignores modern examples where partnerships succeed, advocating for outdated government-only models.  \n- **Crucial Impact:** Innovation is key to advancing space exploration, and private-sector leadership accelerates progress.\n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Economic growth benefits from private dominance vs. Government ensures societal benefits.**\n\n- **Quote:** \"The opposition emphasizes societal benefits over economic growth.\"\n- **Our Case Strength:** The $460 billion global space economy in 2022, with private companies like Space tourism pioneers, demonstrates economic growth driven by private sector dominance.  \n- **Their Response Gaps:** The opposition overlooks the economic multiplier effects of private success, which benefits society broadly.  \n- **Crucial Impact:** Economic growth supports broader societal benefits, making private sector dominance a win-win.\n\n---\n\n#### VOTING ISSUES\n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \nThe most critical clash is efficiency and innovation, as these directly address the motion's goal of enhancing space operations. Without efficiency, space activities cannot scale, and without innovation, progress stagnates.\n\n**Case Proof:**  \nWinning the efficiency debate proves that transitioning to regulation is necessary. This shift fosters economic growth and ensures innovation continues at an unprecedented pace.\n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nWhile the opposition raises valid concerns about national security, these can be managed through regulation and partnerships. The Proposition's evidence of private sector success outweighs the opposition's outdated examples. The motion is validated by the clear benefits of transitioning to regulation: efficiency, innovation, and economic growth.\n\n---\n\n### Bet Amount\n\n</close_speech>"

The historical examples provided by the opposition demonstrate the necessity of government involvement in critical areas, which are not adequately addressed by private entities. Therefore, I am confident that my arguments are stronger and will prevail in this debate. My bet reflects this belief in a 70% chance of winning.\n</bet_logic_private>\n\n\n---\n\n**Rebuttal Speech**\n\n**Motion:** This House believes that governments should transition their primary role in space from direct operation to regulation and oversight of private sector space activities.\n\n**Team:** Opposition\n\n**Speaker:** [Your Name]\n\n---\n\n### CLASH POINT 1\n\n**Original Claim:** Transitioning to regulation and oversight enhances efficiency in space operations.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:** While efficiency is undeniably important, the proposition overlooks the critical role of government in national security. Historical evidence shows that government direct operations were pivotal during the Cold War, such as the launch of Sputnik and the Apollo 11 mission. These operations were not driven by profit but by strategic necessity, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on private sector efficiency.\n\n**Impact:** Without government oversight, national security risks increase, making this challenge fundamental to the debate.\n\n---\n\n### CLASH POINT 2\n\n**Original Claim:** Private sector involvement drives innovation.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n\n**Challenge:** While private companies like SpaceX have indeed driven innovation, the proposition's claim ignores the foundational government investments. For instance, the Apollo program and GPS technology were government initiatives that laid the groundwork for private sector advancements. These innovations demonstrate that government funding is often the catalyst for private sector breakthroughs, not a replacement for them.\n\n**Impact:** This critique underscores the necessity of government investment in high-risk, high-reward projects, which private entities are less likely to undertake.\n\n---\n\n### CLASH POINT 3\n\n**Original Claim:** Economic growth benefits from private sector dominance.\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:** The proposition's emphasis on economic growth overlooks the broader societal benefits of government initiatives. For example, the Space Shuttle program not only advanced technology but also inspired future generations and fostered international cooperation. Economic growth is important, but it must be balanced with these broader societal impacts, which require government leadership.\n\n**Impact:** This challenge highlights the need for a balanced approach, where government oversight ensures both economic and societal benefits.\n\n---\n\n### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\n\n**Vulnerabilities:** The opposition's reliance on historical examples might be perceived as outdated, but these examples remain relevant in the strategic context of space today.\n\n**Additional Support:** The Indian Space Research Organisation's Mars Orbiter Mission is a testament to how government leadership can achieve innovative, cost-effective space exploration, reinforcing the need for continued government involvement.\n\n**Why We Prevail:** The opposition's arguments on national security, investment, and leadership are superior in addressing the broader implications of space exploration, ensuring long-term benefits and security.\n\n---\n\n### WEIGHING\n\n**Key Clash Points:** The most crucial disagreements center on the role of government in national security and high-risk projects. The impact of these points far exceeds the economic efficiency and innovation arguments presented by the proposition.\n\n**Why We Win:** The opposition's arguments on national security and government investment are compelling and directly address the motion's core concerns, ensuring a stronger case.\n\n**Overall Impact:** Winning these key points demonstrates that government oversight is essential for maintaining strategic advantages and societal benefits, proving the motion's validity.\n</bet_amount>\n```",

However, these arguments overlook the critical role of government in ensuring national security, investing in high-risk projects, and fostering technological leadership.\n\n### KEY CLASHES\n\n**1. National Security Over Efficiency**\n\n- **Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n- **Challenge:** The proposition emphasizes efficiency, citing private sector examples like SpaceX. However, national security requires government control, as seen during the Cold War and in modern defense programs. Private entities prioritize profit over strategic necessity, making them unsuitable for handling sensitive operations.\n- **Impact:** Without direct government involvement, national security risks increase, compromising long-term strategic interests.\n\n**2. Government Investment in High-Risk Projects**\n\n- **Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique\n- **Challenge:** The proposition claims private-public partnerships suffice, but history shows government initiatives are essential. The Apollo program and GPS development were government-driven, laying the groundwork for private innovation.\n- **Impact:** High-risk projects demand significant, continuous investment, which private entities are unlikely to sustain without government backing.\n\n**3. Technological Leadership Through Government Oversight**\n\n- **Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n- **Challenge:** While the private sector drives innovation, government leadership sets the stage for advancements. Examples like the Space Shuttle and India's Mars mission highlight how government oversight accelerates technological progress.\n- **Impact:** Government initiative ensures ambitious, long-term goals are met, fostering global leadership.\n\n### VOTING ISSUES\n\n**Priority Analysis:**\n- National security and strategic interests are paramount, outweighing economic efficiency.\n- Government investment in high-risk projects ensures foundational technological advancements.\n- Technological leadership requires sustained government oversight.\n\n### Final Weighing\n\nThe opposition's arguments on national security, investment, and leadership are critical for space exploration's future. While the private sector contributes, it cannot replace the necessity of government oversight in these areas. Transitioning to regulation risks neglecting these pillars, hindering overall progress.\n\n### Bet Amount\n```xml\n\n```"

As the opposition, I argue that government direct involvement is crucial for national security, economic investment in high-risk projects, and technological leadership. Historical examples like the Cold War's space initiatives and the Apollo program support the necessity of government involvement. While the private sector contributes, they cannot adequately address critical areas like national security. Therefore, I am confident that my arguments based on these key areas will prove that government operation remains essential, outweighing the proposition's points. My confidence in winning is 70%."
