    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "rebuttal": "REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nCLASH POINT 1: Media Autonomy and Editorial Independence\nOriginal Claim: \"Mandating equal coverage violates fundamental principles of journalistic editorial discretion and freedom of the press.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\n\nChallenge:\nThe opposition's argument fundamentally misunderstands democratic media responsibility. While editorial independence is important, it is not absolute. Media, especially national broadcasters with significant public reach, have a civic responsibility to provide balanced political information.\n\nKey Counter-Principles:\n1. Democratic Transparency Principle: Citizens have a right to comprehensive political information, not just what editors deem \"newsworthy\"\n2. Fairness Doctrine Precedent: Historical legal frameworks already recognize limits on unrestricted media discretion\n3. Public Interest Override: When media concentration occurs, state intervention becomes necessary to prevent systemic information manipulation\n\nPractical Demonstration:\n- Current media landscapes often privilege established parties\n- Polling above 10% indicates genuine political relevance\n- Mandatory coverage ensures marginalized perspectives receive fair representation\n\nImpact: This principle reframes media not as an unchecked private entity, but as a crucial democratic infrastructure with corresponding public obligations.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Implementation Challenges\nOriginal Claim: \"The proposed regulation creates unmanageable logistical and definitional complexities.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Evidence\n\nChallenge:\nContrary to the opposition's claim, implementation is entirely feasible with clear regulatory frameworks:\n\nTechnical Solutions:\n- Precise \"prime-time\" can be legally defined as 6-10 PM local time\n- Polling thresholds can use rolling 30-day average from recognized polling organizations\n- Digital tracking systems can easily monitor coverage percentages\n- Response segment guidelines can be standardized (e.g., 3-5 minute segments)\n\nComparative Evidence:\n- European broadcasting regulations already implement similar fairness requirements\n- Canadian broadcast regulations provide sophisticated models of equitable media coverage\n- Technological infrastructure for precise media monitoring exists and is continuously improving\n\nImpact: Implementation challenges are surmountable and do not outweigh democratic communication benefits.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Discourse Quality Argument\nOriginal Claim: \"Mandatory coverage could paradoxically reduce the quality of political information.\"\n\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\n\nChallenge:\nThe opposition's argument incorrectly assumes that current media selection ensures high-quality discourse. In reality, mandatory coverage would:\n- Diversify political narratives\n- Reduce media gatekeeping\n- Force substantive policy discussions\n- Prevent marginalization of emerging political movements\n\nPrinciple of Inclusive Democracy:\n- Political relevance is not solely determined by current popularity\n- 10%+ polling indicates meaningful political constituency\n- Exposure creates accountability and forces serious policy articulation\n\nEmpirical Support:\n- Countries with more inclusive media regulations demonstrate more robust democratic engagement\n- Diverse media representation correlates with higher civic participation rates\n\nImpact: Mandatory coverage enhances, rather than degrades, democratic discourse quality.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Potential administrative complexity\n- Concerns about implementation costs\n- Risk of gaming the system\n\nReinforcing Support:\n- Clear, measurable regulatory guidelines\n- Periodic review and adjustment mechanisms\n- Proportional implementation based on viewership thresholds\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- Principled approach to media fairness\n- Practical, implementable solution\n- Democratic communication enhancement\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n1.

      "opening": "OPENING SPEECH (OPPOSITION)\n\nARGUMENT 1\nCore Claim: Mandatory equal media coverage would fundamentally damage media editorial independence and journalistic integrity.\n\nSupport Type: Principle\nSupport Details:\n- Fundamental principle of press freedom is editorial discretion\n- Governments mandating precise media content distribution represents dangerous state intervention\n- Journalism's core purpose is to provide nuanced, contextual reporting, not mechanical equal time allocation\n- Editorial judgment requires ability to discriminate between newsworthy and non-newsworthy content\n\nConnection: Forcing broadcasters to provide mathematically prescribed coverage undermines the essential journalistic function of curating and contextualizing information.\n\nARGUMENT 2\nCore Claim: The proposed regulation would perversely incentivize smaller political parties to generate controversy to trigger mandatory coverage.\n\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- In countries with similar \"fairness doctrine\" regulations (e.g., parts of Latin America), parties often strategically create inflammatory statements\n- Academic research from media studies demonstrates how mandatory coverage can be gamed by provocative messaging\n- Real-world example: In Brazil, fringe parties regularly make extreme statements to generate mandatory media time\n- Quantitative analysis shows these regulations increase political polarization by rewarding extreme rhetoric\n\nConnection: Mandatory coverage creates a \"controversy marketplace\" where media time becomes a strategic resource to be manipulated rather than a platform for substantive political discourse.\n\nARGUMENT 3\nCore Claim: Technical implementation of this policy would be practically unworkable and create massive administrative burdens.\n\nSupport Type: Evidence\nSupport Details:\n- Complex definitional challenges in determining \"prime time\" across different broadcast schedules\n- Significant legal and technological overhead in tracking precise coverage percentages\n- Computational complexity of monitoring 48-hour response windows\n- Substantial compliance costs that would disproportionately burden smaller broadcasters\n\nConnection: The administrative complexity renders the policy economically and logistically unfeasible, creating more regulatory problems than it solves.\n\nSYNTHESIS\nThese arguments demonstrate that mandatory media coverage represents a misguided attempt to engineer media fairness. By undermining editorial independence, creating perverse political incentives, and generating massive administrative complexity, the proposed regulation would damage rather than improve democratic discourse.\n\nThe core principles of journalistic integrity, combined with the practical implementation challenges, conclusively show that voluntary guidelines remain superior to state-mandated coverage requirements.\n\n",
      "rebuttal": "OPPOSITION REBUTTAL SPEECH\n\nCLASH POINT 1: Media Autonomy\nOriginal Claim: Proposition argues for mandated equal media coverage as a mechanism for fairness\nChallenge Type: Principle Critique\nChallenge:\n- The proposition fundamentally misunderstands the nature of journalistic independence\n- Mandated coverage transforms journalism from an investigative practice to a bureaucratic allocation mechanism\n- True media fairness emerges from editorial integrity, not mathematical distribution\n- Forced coverage creates a performative, checkbox approach to political representation\n- Editorial judgment requires nuanced contextual assessment, which mathematical allocation eliminates\n\nImpact: This challenge strikes at the philosophical core of media's democratic function - its ability to critically evaluate and contextually present information.\n\nCLASH POINT 2: Implementation Feasibility  \nOriginal Claim: Proposition suggests the policy is practically implementable\nChallenge Type: Evidence Critique\nChallenge:\n- Proposition provides no concrete mechanism for defining \"equal coverage\"\n- No explanation of how rapidly changing polling data would be consistently tracked\n- No resolution for potential legal challenges from broadcasters\n- Vague terminology like \"prime-time\" lacks precise operational definition\n- No cost-benefit analysis of regulatory enforcement infrastructure\n\nImpact: The proposal fails basic operational scrutiny, revealing it as a theoretically attractive but practically unworkable concept.\n\nCLASH POINT 3: Democratic Information Quality\nOriginal Claim: Proposition implies mandatory coverage enhances democratic discourse\nChallenge Type: Counter Principle\nChallenge:\n- Mandatory coverage perversely incentivizes provocative, non-substantive political messaging\n- Creates artificial platform for fringe movements without natural public interest\n- Reduces media's gatekeeping function of curating meaningful political communication\n- Transforms political representation into a mathematical allocation problem\n- Ignores the qualitative differences between political actors and messages\n\nImpact: The proposal would likely decrease, not increase, the quality of political information exchange.\n\nDEFENSIVE ANALYSIS\nVulnerabilities:\n- Potential accusation of protecting existing media power structures\n- Risk of appearing opposed to media transparency\n- Potential perception of defending current potentially biased systems\n\nAdditional Support:\n- Emphasize commitment to media quality, not just current models\n- Highlight alternative mechanisms for media accountability\n- Demonstrate nuanced understanding of media's democratic role\n\nWhy We Prevail:\n- More sophisticated understanding of media ecosystem\n- Principled defense of editorial independence\n- Practical assessment of regulatory challenges\n- Protection of information quality over mathematical fairness\n\nWEIGHING\nKey Clash Points:\n- Editorial Independence\n- Practical Implementation\n- Information Quality Preservation\n\nWhy We Win:\n- Demonstrated fundamental flaws in proposition's core principles\n- Showed massive implementation challenges\n- Protected core journalistic functions\n\nOverall Impact:\n- Preservation of media's critical democratic role\n- Prevention of potentially harmful regulatory intervention\n- Maintenance of nuanced, contextual political communication\n\n",
