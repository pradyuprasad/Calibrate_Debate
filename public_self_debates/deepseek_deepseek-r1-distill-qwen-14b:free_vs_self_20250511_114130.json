    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

For instance, during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, media bias was cited as influencing voter perception, with certain candidates receiving disproportionately more coverage.  \n**Connection:** This evidence demonstrates that equal coverage is essential to prevent media bias and ensure informed democratic processes.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n**Core Claim:** Guaranteeing response segments within 48 hours of criticism is crucial for effective political communication.  \n**Support Type:** Expert Testimony  \n**Support Details:** Political communication experts argue that timely responses mitigate criticism's impact. InCanada, broadcasters provide quick response times, leading to more balanced political debates.  \n**Connection:** This highlights the necessity of immediate opportunities for political parties to address issues, enhancing public discourse.\n\n---\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n**Core Claim:** Voluntary fairness codes are insufficient in ensuring unbiased coverage.  \n**Support Type:** Statistics  \n**Support Details:** Data reveals that voluntary codes are often disregarded, as seen in the UK where media bias persisted despite such guidelines.  \n**Connection:** This underscores the need for mandatory regulations to enforce fairness and accountability.\n\n---\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe three arguments collectively demonstrate the need for regulated coverage to ensure a fair and informed democracy. By providing equal prime-time slots and timely response opportunities, broadcasters are held accountable, fostering a level playing field and preventing media bias. This approach upholds democratic principles and ensures public trust in the media, with real-world impacts evident in fostering accurate public opinion and strengthening democratic processes.\n\n---\n\n**Confidence Bet:**  \n",

The evidence lacks context, as these countries have authoritarian regimes where media control is a tool of repression. \n\n**Impact:** Without media independence, public opinion is skewed, which is more detrimental to democracy than the perceived risks of regulation. Ensuring equal coverage prevents media bias, which is vital for informed voters.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Implementing such regulations is impractical and would create bureaucratic challenges.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique\n\n**Challenge:** While administrative burdens exist, the benefits of fair representation outweigh these challenges. Voluntary codes have failed, as seen in the UK, necessitating enforcement. Broadcasters manage complex schedules, so this regulation is manageable.\n\n**Impact:** Fair coverage upholds democratic integrity, a more significant concern than administrative costs.\n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**\n\n**Original Claim:** \"Equal coverage requirements would reduce the diversity of opinions.\"\n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Principle\n\n**Challenge:** Equal opportunity doesn't mean equal quality. Even if some content is less popular, diverse voices enrich public discourse. Examples from Sweden and Germany show diverse perspectives without diluting media quality.\n\n**Impact:** Ensuring diverse voices is crucial for democracy, making equal opportunity a valid approach.\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**\n\n**Vulnerabilities:** The motion's scope and reliance on broadcasters' compliance may leave gaps. Smaller broadcasters could be exempt, but the focus is on major networks. \n\n**Additional Support:** Studies from Sweden and Germany show equal coverage can enhance diversity. Broadcasters adapt to regulations, as seen in the UK, where fairness codes were enforced.\n\n**Why We Prevail:** Our arguments address media bias, timely responses, and the ineffectiveness of voluntary codes. Each point strengthens the case for regulation, ensuring accountability and fair representation.\n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**\n\n**Key Clash Points:** Media independence and practicality are significant but manageable. Diversity is maintained through equal opportunity, which enriches public discourse.\n\n**Why We Win:** Our evidence and principles align with enhancing democracy, outweighing the opposition's concerns.\n\n**Overall Impact:** Winning these points proves the motion, highlighting the necessity of regulation for a fair and informed democracy.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:** The proposition's arguments hold strong, addressing the opposition's concerns while emphasizing the importance of fair media for democracy.\n\n```xml\n\n```",

      "rebuttal": "**Opposition Rebuttal Speech**\n\n**CLASH POINT 1**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Equal prime-time coverage for parties polling above 10% ensures fair representation in news broadcasting.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Evidence Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe supporting evidence cited the 2016 U.S. presidential election, claiming media bias skewed public opinion. However, this example is flawed. Studies show that media coverage alone does not directly determine voter intent, as other factors like personal beliefs and economic conditions play a significant role. The correlation between media coverage and voter perception does not establish causation. Furthermore, the evidence does not quantify how much media coverage influenced the outcome, making it insufficient to prove the necessity of equal prime-time coverage.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nWithout concrete evidence linking media coverage to voter behavior, the claim weakens. Voters are rational actors influenced by multiple factors, not merely media exposure, undermining the argument for mandatory equal coverage.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 2**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Guaranteeing response segments within 48 hours of criticism is crucial for effective political communication.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Principle Critique  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nThe argument assumes that quick responses mitigate criticism's impact. However, evidence from the UK shows that delayed responses sometimes allow politicians to craft nuanced rebuttals, which can be more effective than immediate reactions. Additionally, imposing a 48-hour window could lead to administrative inefficiencies, diverting resources from more critical journalistic tasks.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nThe principle of timely responses is good in theory but impractical in execution. The argument overlooks the complexities of political communication and the potential downsides of rigid timelines, making it less compelling.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH POINT 3**  \n**Original Claim:** \"Voluntary fairness codes are insufficient in ensuring unbiased coverage.\"  \n\n**Challenge Type:** Counter Evidence  \n\n**Challenge:**  \nWhile it is true that voluntary codes are sometimes disregarded, studies in Sweden indicate that when combined with self-regulation and industry oversight, they can be effective. For instance, Sweden's Press Council has successfully mediated disputes, leading to more balanced coverage without the need for mandatory regulations. This evidence shows that a hybrid approach can uphold journalistic integrity better than strict government mandates.  \n\n**Impact:**  \nPresenting evidence of successful self-regulation weakens the argument for mandatory coverage requirements. It demonstrates that alternative solutions can achieve fairness without sacrificing media independence.  \n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS**  \n**Vulnerabilities:**  \n- The rebuttal's reliance on foreign examples may not directly apply to local contexts.  \n- The evidence presented may not fully account for cultural differences in media consumption and political engagement.  \n\n**Additional Support:**  \n- Studies from multiple countries, including Germany and Japan, show that self-regulation combined with public oversight can reduce bias without government intervention.  \n- Expert testimony from media ethicists emphasizes the importance of maintaining editorial independence to prevent political interference.  \n\n**Why We Prevail:**  \n- Our synthesis of evidence shows that mandatory regulations risk undermining media freedom and practicality, outweighing the benefits of equal coverage.  \n- By highlighting the success of voluntary systems and the risks of state control, we provide a more balanced and credible alternative to the proposed motion.  \n\n---\n\n**WEIGHING**  \n**Key Clash Points:**  \n- The insufficiency of evidence linking media coverage to voter behavior.  \n- The impracticality and potential downsides of enforcing response timelines.  \n- The existence of successful voluntary systems as a superior alternative.  \n\n**Why We Win:**  \n- Our detailed critique of the Proposition's evidence and principles demonstrates their weaknesses.  \n- We provide stronger evidence and alternative solutions, making our case more compelling.  \n\n**Overall Impact:**  \nBy addressing the key flaws in the Proposition's arguments and offering a more nuanced perspective, we undermine the case for mandatory coverage requirements, proving that the motion should be opposed to protect media independence and maintain high journalistic standards.  \n\n---\n\n**Confidence Bet:**  \n\n  \n",

These cases show how such regulations can erode press freedom and lead to biased reporting.  \n\n- **Their Response Gaps:**  \n  The proposition downplayed these examples, arguing they don't apply to democratic nations. However, the lack of context in their rebuttal weakens their defense. Media independence is foundational to democracy, and the risk of government influence is too significant to ignore.  \n\n- **Crucial Impact:**  \n  Without media independence, public discourse becomes controlled, undermining democracy. This outweighs the benefits of equal coverage, which can be achieved through other, less intrusive means.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH 2: Practical Implementation Challenges**  \n\n- **Our Case Strength:**  \n  The opposition highlighted the impracticality of enforcing such regulations, including bureaucratic costs and complexities. Voluntary codes have worked in the UK, showing that less invasive methods can suffice.  \n\n- **Their Response Gaps:**  \n  The proposition argued that voluntary codes are ineffective, but failed to provide evidence proving that mandatory regulations are more practical. Their rebuttal relied on unsupported claims about broadcasters' ability to manage schedules.  \n\n- **Crucial Impact:**  \n  Imposing regulations could divert resources from critical journalistic tasks, leading to inefficiencies. The potential downsides of implementation suggest the motion is more harm than good.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH 3: Media Diversity and Quality**  \n\n- **Our Case Strength:**  \n  The opposition argued that equal coverage could dilute media quality and reduce diversity. Studies show that diverse perspectives enrich public discourse, and forcing equal airtime may include lower-quality content.  \n\n- **Their Response Gaps:**  \n  The proposition countered by suggesting equal opportunity doesn't mean equal quality, citing Sweden and Germany. However, these examples focus on diversity, not the quality of coverage, which is a separate concern.  \n\n- **Crucial Impact:**  \n  A vibrant media landscape thrives on diversity and quality. Mandating equal coverage risks prioritizing quantity over quality, potentially harming the public good.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n1. **Media Independence:** Most critical, as it forms the basis of a free press.  \n2. **Practicality:** Without manageable implementation, the policy cannot succeed.  \n3. **Media Quality:** Ensuring high-quality, diverse content benefits public discourse.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- The opposition's evidence and analysis show that mandatory regulations risk media independence and face practical challenges.  \n- Voluntary fairness codes, combined with self-regulation, provide an effective alternative.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nThe proposition's wins on equal coverage are outweighed by the significant risks to media independence and practicality.

Voluntary codes have worked in the UK, showing that less invasive methods can suffice.  \n\n- **Their Response Gaps:**  \n  The proposition argued that voluntary codes are ineffective, but failed to provide evidence proving that mandatory regulations are more practical. Their rebuttal relied on unsupported claims about broadcasters' ability to manage schedules.  \n\n- **Crucial Impact:**  \n  Imposing regulations could divert resources from critical journalistic tasks, leading to inefficiencies. The potential downsides of implementation suggest the motion is more harm than good.  \n\n---\n\n**CLASH 3: Media Diversity and Quality**  \n\n- **Our Case Strength:**  \n  The opposition argued that equal coverage could dilute media quality and reduce diversity. Studies show that diverse perspectives enrich public discourse, and forcing equal airtime may include lower-quality content.  \n\n- **Their Response Gaps:**  \n  The proposition countered by suggesting equal opportunity doesn't mean equal quality, citing Sweden and Germany. However, these examples focus on diversity, not the quality of coverage, which is a separate concern.  \n\n- **Crucial Impact:**  \n  A vibrant media landscape thrives on diversity and quality. Mandating equal coverage risks prioritizing quantity over quality, potentially harming the public good.  \n\n---\n\n**VOTING ISSUES**\n\n**Priority Analysis:**  \n1. **Media Independence:** Most critical, as it forms the basis of a free press.  \n2. **Practicality:** Without manageable implementation, the policy cannot succeed.  \n3. **Media Quality:** Ensuring high-quality, diverse content benefits public discourse.  \n\n**Case Proof:**  \n- The opposition's evidence and analysis show that mandatory regulations risk media independence and face practical challenges.  \n- Voluntary fairness codes, combined with self-regulation, provide an effective alternative.  \n\n**Final Weighing:**  \nThe proposition's wins on equal coverage are outweighed by the significant risks to media independence and practicality. Even if some benefits exist, the negative impacts dominate, making the motion undeserving of adoption.  \n\n---\n\n**Confidence Bet:**  \n\n**  \n\n**Bet Amount:** 75  \n\n---\n\n****"
