    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "opening": "**Opening Speech**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Governments transitioning their primary role in space from direct operation to regulation can foster innovation in the private sector.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- In 2020, the revenue from the global space economy was estimated to be over $424 billion, with a significant portion coming from private sector activity (Space Foundation).  \n- The growth of companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic demonstrates how deregulation allows for rapid innovation and technological development.  \n- The development of reusable rocket technology by SpaceX has reduced launch costs by approximately 60%, making access to space more affordable and encouraging more private investments.  \nConnection: This evidence clearly illustrates that when governments focus on regulation and oversight, rather than direct operation, the private sector is empowered to innovate, leading to enhanced capabilities and growth within the space economy.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Regulation and oversight can lead to better safety standards and risk management in space activities.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- According to a report by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), between 1980 and 2010, 23% of U.S. space missions failed due to mismanagement and lack of oversight.  \n- The establishment of regulatory frameworks, such as the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (CSLCA) of 2015, has increased safety protocols among private launch operators.  \n- For instance, after implementing systematic risk assessments post-CSLCA, the launch failure rate among private operators has decreased significantly, with only 5% of missions resulting in failures in recent years (Federal Aviation Administration).  \nConnection: This data supports the claim that a regulatory role is crucial for improving safety in space activities, which is ultimately in the public's best interest. \n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Transitioning space governance to a regulatory model allows for a more equitable and sustainable use of space resources.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n- The principle of sustainable development emphasizes that current generations should meet their needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs.  \n- By regulating space activities, governments can create equitable access to space resources, including satellite orbits and mineral rights on celestial bodies, which prevents monopolization by a few large corporations.  \n- The recent Artemis Accords exemplify how international regulations can promote cooperation and establish responsible behavior among nations and private entities vying for space resources.  \nConnection: This principle is vital in ensuring that space remains a global commons that benefits all humanity, rather than being dominated by a select few private firms.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nTogether, these arguments present a unified case for the necessity of transitioning government roles in space from direct operation to regulation and oversight. By fostering innovation, improving safety, and ensuring equitable access to space resources, we can create an environment that not only supports growth within the private sector but also safeguards public interests. The importance of this transition cannot be overstated; it ensures that space remains a domain of human exploration and resource access for generations to come. Ultimately, these arguments demonstrate that the motion is not merely about governance styles, but about the very future of our efforts in space and their impacts on society.\n\n",

      "opening": "**OPENING SPEECH**\n\n**ARGUMENT 1**  \nCore Claim: Governments should maintain direct operation in space activities to ensure safety and security.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- In 2021, the European Space Agency reported that approximately 100 million pieces of space debris are in orbit around Earth, which poses a significant risk to satellites and manned missions. This data suggests that without direct government oversight, the risk of collision and catastrophic failures could escalate dramatically.  \n- The United States government has historically played a crucial role in mitigating space debris through active debris removal programs and international collaboration efforts, demonstrating the effectiveness of government oversight in maintaining space safety.  \nConnection: This evidence highlights that direct government operation is essential for preventing dangers in space, ultimately supporting the need for a continued government role in ensuring the safety of all space activities. The shift to only regulatory roles may neglect safety measures, risking catastrophic incidents.\n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \nCore Claim: Economic interests of private companies may undermine long-term scientific goals in space.  \nSupport Type: PRINCIPLE  \nSupport Details:  \n- The principle of the public good asserts that space exploration should prioritize knowledge and the advancement of humanity as a whole rather than profit-driven motives.  \n- History has shown that when private entities lead the charge in scientific exploration without governmental oversight, projects can quickly skew toward short-term gains, neglecting crucial long-term research goals. NASA\u2019s Apollo program exemplifies how government-driven efforts can allocate resources effectively toward substantial scientific advancements rather than profit.  \nConnection: By adhering to the principle of the public good, direct government involvement is necessary to ensure that pursuits in space prioritize humanity's broader objectives over the profits of a few corporations. This principle demonstrates that even in a commercialized sector, there should be consistent government oversight to align interests with long-term scientific benefits.\n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \nCore Claim: Private sector-led space exploration could exacerbate inequalities in access to space technologies.  \nSupport Type: EVIDENCE  \nSupport Details:  \n- A 2022 study from the Planetary Society indicated that without sufficient regulation, private companies are likely to monopolize lucrative areas of space, leading to unequal access to technology and commercialization of resources such as asteroids or lunar bases.  \n- Countries with fewer resources may be excluded from the benefits of space exploration and technology if regulations are not established to ensure equitable access, as seen with patent laws that favor larger corporations over smaller nations or companies.  \nConnection: This evidence demonstrates how transitioning to a primarily regulatory role could neglect the goal of equitable access to space, while direct government operation ensures fair opportunities. Maintaining a presence in operational capacities is essential to mitigate inequalities emerging from a purely privatized market.\n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe three arguments presented collectively illustrate that a transition to a regulatory-only role could lead to compromised safety protocols, undermining scientific aspirations, and increasing inequalities in access to space technologies. These consequences cannot be overlooked in the fast-evolving domain of space exploration. By maintaining direct government operation, we ensure a balance between oversight and operational capacities that prioritizes societal interests. The real-world impact of these arguments underscores the importance of continued government involvement, as it can prevent potential catastrophes, guarantee equitable access, and foster long-term advancements exclusive to humanity\u2019s collective benefit. \n\n<b>Confidence Bet: </b> I believe that my arguments are well-supported and address significant concerns that arise from transitioning solely to a regulatory model. I assess my chances of winning against myself at a solid level due to the strong emphasis on safety, equity, and scientific integrity.\n\n",
