    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

For instance, in the UK, Ofcom-regulated broadcasters consistently allocate airtime proportionate to polling numbers without government-mandated quotas.  \n- Specific data shows that over the past decade, major broadcasters have allocated an average of 32% of debate airtime to the leading opposition party, even when their polling numbers dipped below 20%.  \n- In the 2020 U.S. election, despite President Trump's contentious relationship with the media, major networks like NBC and ABC adhered to voluntary fairness codes, ensuring equal airtime for both candidates in debates.  \n*Connection:* These examples demonstrate that the existing system works and that mandatory quotas may undermine the very diversity of voices they aim to protect.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 2**  \n*Core Claim:* Mandating guaranteed response segments within 48 hours of criticism violates press freedom and editorial independence.  \n*Support Type:* Principle  \n*Support Details:*  \n- The principle of editorial independence is central to a free press. Journalists and broadcasters must be free to choose what stories to cover and how to frame them without interference from external entities, including the government.  \n- The Media Literacy Council in Singapore found that mandatory response segments can lead to \"echo chambers,\" as broadcasters prioritize rebuttals over critical analysis to avoid accusations of bias.  \n- For example, during the 2019 Australian federal election, broadcasters faced scrutiny for perceived bias. However, it was their editorial discretion that ultimately balanced coverage, not government intervention.  \n*Connection:* Mandating response segments risks transforming news into a PR tool for political parties, eroding the press's role as an independent arbiter of public discourse.  \n\n**ARGUMENT 3**  \n*Core Claim:* The proposed regulations could lead to unintended consequences, such as reduced coverage of smaller parties and increased polarization.  \n*Support Type:* Evidence  \n*Support Details:*  \n- A study by the European Union's Media Pluralism Monitor found that mandatory coverage quotas in some member states resulted in a 15% decline in coverage of niche and extremist parties, as broadcasters focused on the mainstream.  \n- In France, during the 2017 presidential election, Le Monde reported that mandatory coverage of smaller parties led to superficial reporting, as journalists prioritized meeting quotas over in-depth analysis.  \n- Specific cases like these highlight how such regulations unintentionally distort the media landscape, often to the detriment of public understanding.  \n*Connection:* These examples underscore the potential harm of imposing rigid coverage requirements, which could marginalize voices rather than elevate them.  \n\n**SYNTHESIS**  \nThe three arguments presented here work together to show that the proposed motion is both unnecessary and potentially harmful. Existing voluntary frameworks have proven effective, and mandatory quotas risk stifling diversity, violating press freedom, and creating echo chambers. The practical impact of these regulations could erode public trust in the media and undermine the democratic process. While the intention to ensure fair coverage is noble, the evidence and principles outlined demonstrate that the current system is working and that government-mandated rules could do more harm than good.  \n\n---\n\n**Confidence Bet:**  \n<BET_LOGIC_PRIVATE>  \nGiven the robust evidence and principles presented, I am confident that the opposition's case is well-supported by existing data and precedents. The motion risks creating unintended consequences, as shown by historical examples. While the proposition may argue for greater fairness, the opposition's arguments demonstrate that the current system is functioning adequately and that mandatory rules could harm media independence and diversity. I estimate a 70% chance of winning this debate based on the judging criteria, particularly the emphasis on evidence quality and logical validity.  \n</BET_LOGIC_PRIVATE>  \n\n<BET_AMOUNT>70</BET_AMOUNT>",

However, these examples are insufficient. The ADR study is an isolated case and does not account for the complexities of different electoral systems. The U.S. 2016 election is a single instance and cannot be generalized. Moreover, both examples do not establish a direct causal link between media coverage and voter behavior.

They also fail to address how mandates can distort coverage, prioritizing dominant narratives and excluding smaller parties.\n</their_response_gaps>\n<crucial_impact>\nThis clash is fundamental as it determines whether the motion is necessary.

The 2019 Australian election example showed balanced coverage through discretion, not mandates.\n</our_case_strength>\n<their_response_gaps>\nThe proposition overlooks how mandates can undermine the media's role as an independent arbiter. They fail to consider how such requirements might lead to superficial coverage focused on meeting quotas.\n</their_response_gaps>\n<crucial_impact>\nThis clash addresses the balance between accountability and freedom.

France's 2017 election example illustrates reduced in-depth coverage due to quota pressures, highlighting unintended consequences.\n</our_case_strength>\n<their_response_gaps>\nThe proposition ignores evidence of harm from mandates, focusing only on perceived benefits. They fail to address how quotas can distort the media landscape, reducing diversity.\n</their_response_gaps>\n<crucial_impact>\nThis clash determines whether the motion enhances or harms diversity.
