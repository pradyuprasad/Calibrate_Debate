    "judge_prompt": "You are an expert debate judge. Your role is to analyze formal debates using the following strictly prioritized criteria:\nI. Core Judging Principles (In order of importance):\nDirect Clash Resolution:\nIdentify all major points of disagreement (clashes) between the teams.\nFor each clash:\nQuote the exact statements representing each side's position.\nAnalyze the logical validity of each argument within the clash. Is the reasoning sound, or does it contain fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization, correlation/causation, straw man, etc.)? Identify any fallacies by name.\nAnalyze the quality of evidence presented within that specific clash. Define \"quality\" as:\nDirect Relevance: How directly does the evidence support the claim being made? Does it establish a causal link, or merely a correlation?  Explain the difference if a causal link is claimed but not proven.\nSpecificity: Is the evidence specific and verifiable (e.g., statistics, named examples, expert testimony), or vague and general?  Prioritize specific evidence.\nSource Credibility (If Applicable): If a source is cited, is it generally considered reliable and unbiased? If not, explain why this weakens the evidence.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of each side's rebuttals within the clash. Define \"effectiveness\" as:\nDirect Response: Does the rebuttal directly address the opponent's claim and evidence?  If not, explain how this weakens the rebuttal.\nUndermining: Does the rebuttal successfully weaken the opponent's argument (e.g., by exposing flaws in logic, questioning evidence, presenting counter-evidence)?  Explain how the undermining occurs.\nExplicitly state which side wins the clash and why, referencing your analysis of logic, evidence, and rebuttals. Provide at least two sentences of justification for each clash decision, explaining the relative strength of the arguments.\nTrack the evolution of arguments through the debate within each clash. How did the claims and responses change over time? Note any significant shifts or concessions.\nArgument Hierarchy and Impact:\nIdentify the core arguments of each side (the foundational claims upon which their entire case rests).\nExplain the logical links between each core argument and its supporting claims/evidence. Are the links clear, direct, and strong?  If not, explain why this weakens the argument.\nAssess the stated or clearly implied impacts of each argument. What are the consequences if the argument is true? Be specific.\nDetermine the relative importance of each core argument to the overall debate. Which arguments are most central to resolving the motion? State this explicitly and justify your ranking.\nWeighing Principled vs. Practical Arguments: When weighing principled arguments (based on abstract concepts like rights or justice) against practical arguments (based on real-world consequences), consider:\n(a) the strength and universality of the underlying principle;\n(b) the directness, strength, and specificity of the evidence supporting the practical claims; and\n(c) the extent to which the practical arguments directly address, mitigate, or outweigh the concerns raised by the principled arguments.  Explain your reasoning.\nConsistency and Contradictions:\nIdentify any internal contradictions within each team's case (arguments that contradict each other).\nIdentify any inconsistencies between a team's arguments and their rebuttals.\nNote any dropped arguments (claims made but not responded to). For each dropped argument:\nAssess its initial strength based on its logical validity and supporting evidence, as if it had not been dropped.\nThen, consider the impact of it being unaddressed. Does the lack of response significantly weaken the overall case of the side that dropped it? Explain why or why not.\nII. Evaluation Requirements:\nSteelmanning: When analyzing arguments, present them in their strongest possible form, even if you disagree with them. Actively look for the most charitable interpretation.\nArgument-Based Decision: Base your decision solely on the arguments made within the debate text provided. Do not introduce outside knowledge or opinions.  If an argument relies on an unstated assumption, analyze it only if that assumption is clearly and necessarily implied by the presented arguments.\nIgnore Presentation: Disregard presentation style, speaking quality, rhetorical flourishes, etc. Focus exclusively on the substance of the arguments and their logical connections.\nFramework Neutrality: If both sides present valid but competing frameworks for evaluating the debate, maintain neutrality between them. Judge the debate based on how well each side argues within their chosen framework, and according to the prioritized criteria in Section I.\nIII. Common Judging Errors to AVOID:\nIntervention: Do not introduce your own arguments or evidence.\nShifting the Burden of Proof: Do not place a higher burden of proof on one side than the other. Both sides must prove their claims to the same standard.\nOver-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments: Do not automatically favor arguments based on \"real-world\" examples over principled or theoretical arguments. Evaluate all arguments based on the criteria in Section I.\nIgnoring Dropped Arguments: Address all dropped arguments as specified in I.3.\nDouble-Counting: Do not give credit for the same argument multiple times.\nAssuming Causation from Correlation: Be highly skeptical of arguments that claim causation based solely on correlation. Demand clear evidence of a causal mechanism.\nNot Justifying Clash Decisions: Provide explicit justification for every clash decision, as required in I.1.\nIV. Decision Making:\nWinner: The winner must be either \"Proposition\" or \"Opposition\" (no ties).\nConfidence Level: Assign a confidence level (0-100) reflecting the margin of victory. A score near 50 indicates a very close debate.\n90-100: Decisive Victory\n70-89: Clear Victory\n51-69: Narrow Victory.\nExplain why you assigned the specific confidence level.\nKey Factors: Identify the 2-3 most crucial factors that determined the outcome. These should be specific clashes or arguments that had the greatest impact on your decision. Explain why these factors were decisive.\nDetailed Reasoning: Provide a clear, logical, and detailed explanation for your conclusion. Explain how the key factors interacted to produce the result. Reference specific arguments and analysis from sections I-III. Show your work, step-by-step. Do not simply state your conclusion; justify it with reference to the specific arguments made.\nV. Line-by-Line Justification:\nCreate a section titled \"V. Line-by-Line Justification.\"\nIn this section, provide at least one sentence referencing each and every section of the provided debate text (Prop 1, Opp 1, Prop Rebuttal 1, Opp Rebuttal 1, Prop Final, Opp Final). This ensures that no argument, however minor, goes unaddressed. You may group multiple minor arguments together in a single sentence if they are closely related. The purpose is to demonstrate that you have considered the entirety of the debate.\nVI. Format for your response:\nOrganize your response in clearly marked sections exactly corresponding to the sections above (I.1, I.2, I.3, II, III, IV, V). This structured output is mandatory. Your response must follow this format to be accepted.\n\n\n\nformat:\nwrite all your thoughts out\nthen put in XML tags\n<winnerName>opposition|proposition</winnerName> \\n        <confidence>0-100</confidence>\\n\n\nThese existing is compulsory as the parser will fail otherwise\n"

      "closing": "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, as we reach the conclusion of this debate, let us underline why the proposition clearly emerges victorious.\n\n**Key Clash One: Academic Enrichment through Advocacy**\nOur first clash centers on whether professors engaging in public advocacy enriches the academic community. The opposition claims that advocacy compromises objectivity. However, this assertion fails to recognize that many academic disciplines intersect deeply with social and political issues. For instance, in fields like climate science, engaging in public discourse is not merely an option but a responsibility. Professors can maintain objectivity while informing the public and informing policy. Our evidence shows that this engagement enriches public discourse, offering complex insights that contribute to societal understanding. The opposition's stance weakens when viewed through this lens of responsibility, which enhances the argument that professors should actively participate in advocacy.\n\n**Key Clash Two: Diversity of Viewpoints**\nSecondly, we discussed the diversity of viewpoints within academia. The opposition posits that advocacy could stifle minority perspectives due to the pressures of conformity. Yet, experiences from universities implementing public engagement initiatives demonstrate that such efforts can amplify a range of academic voices, enriching discussions rather than constraining them. Engaging professors in public debate leads to the emergence of diverse perspectives across contentious issues. This serves as a critical rebuttal to the opposition's claim, reinforcing that public advocacy not only maintains but can enhance the diversity of thought in academia.\n\n**Key Clash Three: Recognition of Skills**\nFinally, the opposition points to the potential lack of communication skills among professors as a reason against engagement in public advocacy. We acknowledge that not every professor may feel inclined to take on a public role. However, instead of viewing this as a deterrent, we argue for an institutional responsibility to support and equip those willing to engage. Academic institutions can offer training and resources, creating an environment where professors feel capable and empowered to participate in public discussions. This refocusing aligns with the necessity for academia to adapt to society\u2019s evolving expectations, emphasizing the importance of public advocacy as part of a professor's academic responsibility.\n\n**Summation of Impact**\nWinning in these critical areas demonstrates that the proactive involvement of professors in public advocacy is essential. It bolsters academic integrity by enhancing public discourse and informs policy decisions through expert insight. Furthermore, encouraging advocacy fosters a richer academic environment that values diversity and responsibility. \n\nWhile the opposition raised concerns about potential drawbacks, the long-term benefits of professors engaging in public advocacy substantially outweigh these issues. The case for professors as active public advocates is not merely beneficial; it is necessary for fostering informed citizenry, shaping policy, and upholding the societal role of the academic community.\n\nIn conclusion, we affirm that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise. Thank you."

When professors engage in public advocacy, they may be seen as taking a political stance, which could undermine their credibility and the credibility of their research.

For example, a survey by the American Association of University Professors found that a significant number of professors reported feeling hesitant to express their opinions on certain topics due to fear of backlash or repercussions. This lack of diversity in viewpoints can stifle academic debate and hinder the pursuit of knowledge.\n        </supportDetails>\n        <connection>\n            This evidence supports the claim because if professors are expected to advocate for specific social and political issues, it can create an environment where certain viewpoints are favored over others.

For instance, a professor of mathematics may be an expert in their field but not necessarily comfortable speaking to the media or the general public about their research.

Rather than expecting all professors to engage in public advocacy, we should encourage and support those who are inclined and skilled in this area to take on such roles, while allowing others to focus on their research and teaching.\n        </connection>\n    </argument3>\n    <synthesis>\n        In conclusion, the arguments presented demonstrate that expecting professors to actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise can compromise their objectivity, lead to a lack of diversity in viewpoints, and overlook the varied skills and interests of academics. These concerns work together to underscore the importance of maintaining a clear distinction between the role of professors as experts in their field and their potential roles as public advocates. By not obligating professors to engage in public advocacy, we can protect academic integrity, foster a diverse and inclusive academic environment, and ensure that professors can focus on their core responsibilities of research and teaching. Ultimately, this approach will better serve the pursuit of knowledge, the advancement of understanding, and the public interest.\n    </synthesis>\n</speech>",

However, this overlooks the fact that many fields of study, such as environmental science or public health, inherently involve issues of social and political relevance. Professors in these fields are not only experts but also have a responsibility to inform the public and policymakers about the implications of their research.

When professors are encouraged to share their expertise with the public, it can lead to a more nuanced understanding of complex issues, showcasing the multiplicity of academic perspectives.

This can include training and resources for professors to develop their communication skills, as well as incentives for public engagement that recognize its value alongside research and teaching.

By providing resources, training, and recognition for public engagement, universities can ensure that professors are supported in their efforts, and their core responsibilities are not compromised. Additionally, highlighting successful models of public engagement that have enhanced academic work and public discourse can further bolster our argument.\n    </preemptiveDefense>\n    <weighing>\n        The most critical clash points in this debate are the potential impact of public advocacy on academic objectivity and the diversity of viewpoints within academia. Our challenges to the opposition's claims on these issues are pivotal because they directly address the core concerns raised against the proposition. By demonstrating that public advocacy can enhance academic discourse, inform policy decisions, and promote a diverse range of viewpoints without compromising objectivity, we establish a strong foundation for arguing that professors should engage in public advocacy. Ultimately, the debate hinges on recognizing the value of public engagement in enriching both academic work and societal discourse, and our responses provide a comprehensive argument in favor of this recognition.\n    </weighing>\n</rebuttal>",
      "closing": "<fFinalSpeech>\n    <framing>\n        At its core, this debate revolves around two central questions: Can professors maintain their academic integrity while engaging in public advocacy, and should they be expected to do so? The resolution, \"This House believes that professors should actively engage in public advocacy on social and political issues within their field of expertise,\" hinges on addressing these questions effectively. Our argument posits that not only can professors engage in public advocacy without compromising their objectivity, but they also have a responsibility to do so, given the societal implications of their research and expertise.\n    </framing>\n    <keyClashes>\n        <clash1>\n            <quote>\"The principle that professors' objectivity could be compromised by public advocacy assumes that taking a stance on a social or political issue inherently biases one's research or teaching.\"</quote>\n            <explanation>\n                Our evidence and principles are stronger because they demonstrate that public advocacy can actually enhance academic discourse by encouraging open discussion and critique of ideas. The opposition's response falls short by not adequately addressing how academic freedom includes the freedom to express opinions and engage in public discourse. This clash is crucial as it directly pertains to the heart of academic integrity and the role of professors in society.\n            </explanation>\n        </clash1>\n        <clash2>\n            <quote>\"Evidence from universities that have successfully implemented public engagement programs suggests that these initiatives can actually increase diversity in viewpoints.\"</quote>\n            <explanation>\n                The opposition's argument that public engagement leads to a lack of diversity in viewpoints is countered by our evidence showing that such programs can promote a more nuanced understanding of complex issues, thereby enhancing diversity. This makes our side stronger because it highlights the potential of public advocacy to enrich academic and public discourse. The opposition's claim overlooks the multifaceted nature of public engagement and its ability to foster a richer debate.\n            </explanation>\n        </clash2>\n        <clash3>\n            <quote>\"The principle of academic responsibility suggests that while not all professors may be inclined towards public advocacy, those who are should be supported and encouraged.\"</quote>\n            <explanation>\n                Our argument wins this clash by emphasizing the importance of institutional support for public engagement, including training and resources for professors. This approach recognizes the evolving role of academia in society and the value of public engagement alongside research and teaching. The opposition's concern about not all academics being equipped or interested is addressed by our flexible and supportive approach, making our stance more comprehensive and realistic.\n            </explanation>\n        </clash3>\n    </keyClashes>\n    <voting>\n        We win this debate by successfully addressing the core concerns raised against the proposition. Our arguments demonstrate that public advocacy can enhance academic objectivity, promote diversity of viewpoints, and align with the principles of academic responsibility. These points are crucial because they directly impact the role of professors in society, the integrity of academic work, and the potential for academia to contribute positively to public discourse. While the opposition raises valid concerns, our responses provide a more balanced and supportive approach to public engagement, recognizing both its benefits and the need for institutional support. Ultimately, our position that professors should engage in public advocacy is strengthened by our ability to address potential drawbacks and highlight the overall positive impact on academia and society.\n    </voting>\n</fFinalSpeech>"

Core Judging Principles**\n\n**I.1 Direct Clash Resolution**\n\n**Clash 1: Academic Enrichment through Advocacy**\n- **Proposition**: Professors engaging in public advocacy enrich the academic community and foster informed discussions. They cite a study by the American Association of University Professors and examples like Noam Chomsky and Cornel West.\n- **Opposition**: Public advocacy compromises objectivity and academic integrity. They argue that advocacy can lead to biases and undermine trust in academic research.\n- **Analysis**: The Proposition\u2019s evidence is specific and relevant, showing direct benefits of public advocacy. The Opposition\u2019s principle critique is valid but lacks direct evidence of widespread bias. The Proposition\u2019s rebuttal effectively counters by highlighting the responsibility of professors in fields like climate science to engage in public discourse.\n- **Winner**: Proposition. The evidence of societal benefits and the rebuttal\u2019s emphasis on responsibility outweigh the Opposition\u2019s concerns about bias.\n\n**Clash 2: Diversity of Viewpoints**\n- **Proposition**: Public advocacy can amplify diverse academic voices, enriching discussions.\n- **Opposition**: Advocacy can lead to self-censorship and a lack of diversity in viewpoints, citing a survey by the American Association of University Professors.\n- **Analysis**: The Proposition\u2019s counter-evidence from universities with successful public engagement programs is strong and directly challenges the Opposition\u2019s claim. The Opposition\u2019s evidence, while valid, is less specific and does not account for the potential benefits of structured advocacy programs.\n- **Winner**: Proposition. The counter-evidence effectively undermines the Opposition\u2019s claim, showing that advocacy can enhance diversity.\n\n**Clash 3: Recognition of Skills**\n- **Proposition**: Not all professors need to engage in advocacy, but institutions should support those who do, providing training and resources.\n- **Opposition**: Many professors lack the skills or inclination for public advocacy, and expecting them to engage can divert attention from core responsibilities.\n- **Analysis**: The Proposition\u2019s argument is more balanced, acknowledging the diversity of skills among professors and proposing institutional support. The Opposition\u2019s concern is valid but is addressed by the Proposition\u2019s flexible approach.\n- **Winner**: Proposition. The institutional support argument effectively mitigates the Opposition\u2019s concerns.\n\n**I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact**\n- **Proposition\u2019s Core Arguments**: Public advocacy enriches academia, promotes social responsibility, and leads to policy changes. These are well-supported by evidence and principles, with clear links to societal benefits.\n- **Opposition\u2019s Core Arguments**: Advocacy compromises objectivity, reduces diversity, and overlooks professors\u2019 varied skills. These are valid concerns but are less directly supported by evidence and are effectively countered by the Proposition.\n\n**I.3 Consistency and Contradictions**\n- Both sides are consistent in their arguments. The Proposition effectively addresses the Opposition\u2019s concerns, particularly in the rebuttals, showing a clear evolution of arguments.\n\n**II. Evaluation Requirements**\n- **Steelmanning**: Both sides\u2019 arguments were presented in their strongest form.\n- **Argument-Based Decision**: The decision is based solely on the arguments presented.\n- **Ignore Presentation**: Focused exclusively on the substance of the arguments.\n- **Framework Neutrality**: Maintained neutrality, evaluating each side within their chosen framework.\n\n**III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID**\n- No intervention, shifting of burden of proof, or over-reliance on real-world arguments. All dropped arguments were addressed.\n\n**IV. Decision Making**\n- **Winner**: Proposition. The Proposition\u2019s arguments were more effectively supported by evidence and principles, and they successfully countered the Opposition\u2019s concerns.\n- **Confidence Level**: 75 (Clear Victory). The Proposition\u2019s evidence and rebuttals were strong, but the Opposition raised valid concerns that were not entirely dismissed.\n- **Key Factors**: The Proposition\u2019s evidence on the benefits of public advocacy and their effective rebuttals on diversity and skills were decisive.\n\n**V. Line-by-Line Justification**\n- **Proposition Opening Speech**: Strong evidence and principles supporting the benefits of public advocacy.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech**: Valid concerns about objectivity and diversity, but less direct evidence.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal**: Effective counterarguments to the Opposition\u2019s concerns, particularly on diversity and skills.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal**: Attempted to counter the Proposition\u2019s points but was less effective in providing direct evidence.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech**: Strong summation of the benefits of public advocacy and effective rebuttals.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech**: Reiterated concerns but did not sufficiently counter the Proposition\u2019s arguments.\n\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>75</confidence>"

The opposition slightly edges out by highlighting the principle of academic freedom and its link to objectivity. \n  - **Winner**: Opposition.\n  - **Justification**: The opposition successfully emphasizes the crucial principle of maintaining academic integrity and the potential risks advocacy poses to objectivity.\n\n**Clash Two: Social Responsibility & Diversity**\n- **Proposition**: \"Public advocacy promotes diverse viewpoints.\"\n  - **Evidence**: Successful public engagement programs enhance diversity.\n  - **Rebuttal**: Opposition claims it risks self-censorship.\n  - **Logic**: Sound and supported by examples of nuanced discussions leading to more diversity.\n- **Opposition**: \"Advocacy leads to a lack of diversity.\"\n  - **Evidence**: AAUP survey indicates self-censorship due to pressures.\n  - **Rebuttal**: Proposition counters with examples showing increased diversity.\n  - **Logic**: Fallacy of hasty generalization; self-censorship evidence is not definitive across all academia.\n- **Evaluation**: Proposition counters opposition's evidence effectively.\n  - **Winner**: Proposition.\n  - **Justification**: The proposition successfully counters the evidence with examples and highlights the positive impact of public engagement on diversity, making their argument more compelling.\n\n**Clash Three: Skills & Training**\n- **Proposition**: \"Not all professors are suited, but institutional support can empower them.\"\n  - **Evidence**: Need for supportive institutional policies.\n  - **Rebuttal**: Opposition\u2019s claim that professors may not be equipped is met with a flexible approach to training and resources.\n  - **Logic**: Logical and well-supported by the principle of evolving academic roles.\n- **Opposition**: \"Not all professors are equipped to be public figures.\"\n  - **Evidence**: Example of professors hesitant to voice opinions due to potential backlash.\n  - **Rebuttal**: Proposition acknowledges and proposes solutions.\n  - **Logic**: Reasonable but lacks comprehensive evidence.\n- **Evaluation**: Proposition's response is more robust.\n  - **Winner**: Proposition.\n  - **Justification**: Proposition addresses the concern pragmatically with institutional support, making their stance more comprehensive and future-oriented.\n\n#### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n- **Core Arguments**:\n  - **Proposition**: Enrichment of public discourse, promotion of social responsibility, and meaningful policy changes.\n  - **Opposition**: Compromise of academic integrity, lack of diversity, and unsuitability.\n- **Logical Links**: Proposition's arguments are interconnected and supported by evidence of societal benefits. Opposition's arguments hinge on principles of academic freedom but lack robust evidence of widespread bias.\n- **Impact Assessment**: Proposition\u2019s impacts are tangible and directly affect societal progress. Opposition\u2019s impacts, while serious, are more abstract and less substantiated.\n- **Ranking**: Proposition\u2019s arguments on policy changes and enriched discourse are most central.\n\n#### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions\n\n- **Consistency**:\n  - **Proposition**: Strong internal consistency.\n  - **Opposition**: Also consistent but less substantiated in its claims of widespread bias.\n- **Dropped Arguments**:\n  - **Proposition**: None significant.\n  - **Opposition**: The argument about professors' natural engagement not compromising integrity is slightly weak.\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n**Steelmanning**: Both sides are presented in their strongest form. \n**Argument-Based Decision**: No outside knowledge or opinions are introduced. \n**Framework Neutrality**: Judged strictly on the arguments within the debate.\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\nNo intervention or reliance on \"real-world\" assumptions. Each dropped argument is addressed.\n\n### IV. Decision Making\n\n#### Winner:\nThe debate is very close but ultimately favors the **proposition**.\n\n#### Confidence Level:\n- **Score**: 55/100.\n- **Explanation**: Narrow Victory. The proposition slightly edges out because it effectively counters the opposition's claims on diversity and offers pragmatic solutions on professorial engagement, making their arguments more compelling.\n\n#### Key Factors:\n1. **Diversity of Viewpoints**: Proposition successfully demonstrates how public advocacy can enhance diversity rather than stifle it.\n2. **Institutional Support**: Proposition's flexible and supportive approach to training professors underscores the evolving role of academia, effectively addressing concerns about professors' capabilities.\n\n#### Detailed Reasoning:\nThe proposition effectively addresses the core concerns of the opposition, particularly on diversity and professorial training. The opposition's claims about compromised objectivity and lack of diversity are countered convincingly. While the opposition raises valid concerns, these are adequately mitigated by the proposition's comprehensive approach.\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech**: Effectively sets up strong evidence and principle-based arguments.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech**: Raises valid concerns but relies on less substantiated principles.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal**: Successfully counters opposition's evidence with solid counterarguments.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal**: Strong counter-principle arguments but slightly weakened by the lack of robust evidence.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech**: Summarizes key points effectively, emphasizing their practical approach.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech**: Framing is strong, but evidence is less compelling compared to the proposition's pragmatic solutions.\n\n```xml\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>55</confidence>\n```"

      "logic": "### I. Core Judging Principles\n\n#### I.1 Direct Clash Resolution\n\n**Clash 1: Academic Enrichment through Advocacy**\n- **Proposition Claim**: Professors engaging in public advocacy enrich the academic community and foster informed discussions.\n  - **Evidence**: Study by the American Association of University Professors showing heightened public interest in academic research and better-informed citizens due to professors like Noam Chomsky and Cornel West.\n  - **Connection**: Advocacy enhances societal understanding of complex subjects, benefiting academic discourse.\n- **Opposition Challenge**: Public advocacy compromises objectivity and academic integrity.\n  - **Principle**: Academic freedom implies research without external pressures or biases. Public advocacy risks aligning research with political agendas, leading to lost neutrality.\n  - **Impact**: Preservation of academic integrity is crucial for maintaining credibility and public trust in scholarly work.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- **Logic**: Both sides make valid points. Proposition\u2019s logic hinges on the benefit to society from enriched public discourse, while Opposition\u2019s focuses on maintaining integrity and objectivity.\n- **Evidence**: Proposition\u2019s evidence is strong, citing specific examples and studies showing positive impacts. Opposition's principle-based argument is plausible but lacks direct evidence.\n- **Rebuttals**: Proposition\u2019s rebuttal that many academic disciplines inherently involve social and political issues is strong. This weakens the opposition by showing advocacy doesn't always equate to bias.\n- **Clash Winner**: Proposition. The specific evidence supporting the positive societal impact outweighs the theoretical risk to objectivity.\n\n**Clash 2: Diversity of Viewpoints**\n- **Proposition Claim**: Engagement in public advocacy promotes social responsibility and accountability among scholars.\n  - **Evidence**: Principle of academic freedom and ethical obligation to share expertise.\n  - **Connection**: Advocacy is a responsibility, not just a right.\n- **Opposition Challenge**: Public advocacy can lead to a lack of diversity in viewpoints.\n  - **Evidence**: Studies indicating self-censorship due to fear of backlash.\n  - **Connection**: Pressures to engage can suppress minority opinions, hindering academic freedom.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- **Logic**: Opposition\u2019s logic of self-censorship and suppressed minority views is compelling. Proposition\u2019s principle-based argument is weaker here.\n- **Evidence**: Opposition provides studies showing self-censorship, which is direct and relevant. Proposition\u2019s evidence lacks specificity.\n- **Rebuttals**: Proposition counters with evidence from universities where engagement increased diversity. This directly addresses the core argument.\n- **Clash Winner**: Proposition. The counter-evidence of diversity-enhancing initiatives is stronger than the initial argument about suppressed views.\n\n**Clash 3: Recognition of Skills**\n- **Proposition Claim**: Public advocacy by professors can lead to meaningful policy changes and societal progress.\n  - **Evidence**: Climate scientists influencing policies like the Paris Agreement.\n  - **Connection**: Advocacy translates academic knowledge into beneficial societal changes.\n- **Opposition Challenge**: Not all academics are equipped or interested in being public figures.\n  - **Evidence**: Many professors lack communication skills or inclination for public advocacy.\n  - **Connection**: Expecting all professors to advocate places undue stress and detracts from core responsibilities.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- **Logic**: Both logical arguments are solid. Proposition highlights meaningful change, while Opposition stresses practical limitations.\n- **Evidence**: Proposition\u2019s historical instances are robust, while Opposition\u2019s practical limitations are also well-supported.\n- **Rebuttals**: Proposition argues for institutional support, mitigating the skill issue. This is effective in addressing the concern.\n- **Clash Winner**: Tie. Both sides provide strong, balanced arguments with no clear victor in this clash.\n\n#### I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n- **Core Arguments**:\n  - Proposition: Advocacy enriches discourse, promotes responsibility, leads to societal progress.\n  - Opposition: Advocacy compromises objectivity, limits viewpoint diversity, overlooks practical constraints.\n- **Logical Links**:\n  - Proposition links are strong, with clear societal benefits and ethical obligations.\n  - Opposition links are somewhat weaker, as some principles lack direct evidence.\n- **Impact Assessment**:\n  - Proposition impacts (better discourse, progress, responsibility) are substantial and well-supported.\n  - Opposition impacts (objectivity, diversity, practicality) are significant but less convincingly demonstrated.\n\n#### I.3 Consistency and Contradictions\n\n- **Consistency**: Both teams maintain consistent arguments throughout.\n- **Contradictions**: None significant.\n- **Dropped Arguments**: No critical dropped arguments.\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning**: Each argument evaluated in its strongest form.\n- **Argument-Based Decision**: Decision based solely on provided arguments.\n- **Framework Neutrality**: Balanced consideration of principle and practice.\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID\n\n- No intervention or burden-shifting. Evaluated arguments objectively.\n\n### IV. Decision Making\n\n#### Winner\nThe Proposition wins. Their arguments around the enrichment of discourse, responsibility, and meaningful societal change are compelling and well-supported with direct evidence and effective rebuttals.\n\n#### Confidence Level\n- **Confidence**: 70 (Clear Victory)\n\n**Key Factors**:\n1. Proposition's evidence on the societal benefits of professors engaging in public advocacy outweighs concerns about objectivity.\n2. Successful rebuttals on diversity and institutional support mitigate key opposition points.\n\n**Detailed Reasoning**: The Proposition consistently provides strong evidence and principled arguments, winning two out of three major clashes decisively. The Opposition's concerns about objectivity and diversity are valid but not as rigorously supported or effectively rebutted.\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech**: The core claims about enrichment, responsibility, and societal progress are robust and well-supported with specific evidence.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech**: Objectivity, diversity, and practicality concerns are logical but lack the strong evidence and impact shown by the Proposition.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal**: Effectively counters concerns about objectivity and diversity, offering strong counter-evidence and principles.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal**: Provides solid counterpoints but fails to match the robust evidence provided by the Proposition, particularly in diversity.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech**: Strong summation reinforcing key arguments effectively.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech**: Good attempt to frame the debate but lacks the compelling evidence needed to sway the decision.\n\n```xml\n<winnerName>proposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>70</confidence>\n```"

      "logic": "**I. Core Judging Principles**\n\n**I.1 Direct Clash Resolution**\n\n**Clash 1: Academic Enrichment vs. Compromised Objectivity**\n\n- **Proposition's Position:**\n  - *Statement:* \u201cProfessors engaging in public advocacy enrich the academic community and foster informed discussions.\u201d\n  - *Analysis:* The proposition provides logical reasoning that professors' involvement in public discourse leads to heightened public interest in academic research and better-informed citizens. The evidence cited includes a study by the American Association of University Professors and examples of professors like Noam Chomsky and Cornel West influencing public opinion. The reasoning is sound, with no apparent fallacies. The evidence is highly relevant, specific, and sourced from credible institutions.\n\n- **Opposition's Position:**\n  - *Statement:* \u201cProfessors should not be obligated to engage in public advocacy as it can compromise their objectivity and academic integrity.\u201d\n  - *Analysis:* The opposition argues that public advocacy may lead professors to align with political agendas, thereby undermining their neutrality and the credibility of their research. While the argument is logically valid, it assumes a direct causation between advocacy and bias without unequivocal evidence, bordering on a slippery slope fallacy.\n\n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n  - The proposition rebuttals effectively counter the opposition by highlighting that professors can engage in advocacy without compromising objectivity, especially in fields inherently linked to societal issues.\n  - The opposition's rebuttal, while raising valid concerns about potential biases, does not sufficiently dismantle the proposition's evidence of enrichment and informed discussions.\n\n- **Clash Decision:** **Proposition Wins**  \n  *Justification:* The proposition presents stronger, well-supported arguments demonstrating that public advocacy enhances academic discourse without necessarily compromising integrity. The opposition's concerns, while valid, lack the empirical backing to outweigh the benefits highlighted by the proposition.\n\n**Clash 2: Social Responsibility vs. Diversity of Viewpoints**\n\n- **Proposition's Position:**\n  - *Statement:* \u201cEngagement in public advocacy promotes social responsibility and accountability among scholars.\u201d\n  - *Analysis:* The proposition bases its argument on the principle of academic freedom, asserting that scholars have an ethical obligation to inform public policy and social justice. The reasoning is sound, emphasizing the duty of professors to contribute to societal discussions.\n\n- **Opposition's Position:**\n  - *Statement:* \u201cForcing professors to engage in public advocacy can lead to a lack of diversity in viewpoints and perspectives within academia.\u201d\n  - *Analysis:* The opposition contends that mandatory advocacy may pressure professors to conform to predominant ideologies, resulting in self-censorship and homogenization of thought. This argument is supported by credible evidence from the American Association of University Professors, highlighting fears of backlash among academics.\n\n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n  - The opposition's rebuttal effectively challenges the proposition by demonstrating that enforced advocacy could suppress minority opinions, thereby reducing the diversity essential for robust academic debate.\n  - The proposition\u2019s rebuttal does not fully address the potential negative impact on viewpoint diversity, weakening its stance.\n\n- **Clash Decision:** **Opposition Wins**  \n  *Justification:* The opposition presents compelling evidence that mandatory public advocacy can undermine the diversity of perspectives within academia. This risk poses a significant threat to the foundational values of academic freedom and robust discourse, outweighing the proposition's claims of social responsibility.\n\n**Clash 3: Policy Impact vs. Professor Capability**\n\n- **Proposition's Position:**\n  - *Statement:* \u201cPublic advocacy by professors can lead to meaningful policy changes and societal progress.\u201d\n  - *Analysis:* The proposition cites instances like climate scientists influencing the Paris Agreement to illustrate how academic advocacy can drive tangible policy outcomes. The argument is logically sound and supported by specific, credible examples.\n\n- **Opposition's Position:**\n  - *Statement:* \u201cExpecting professors to engage in public advocacy overlooks the reality that not all academics are equipped or interested in being public figures.\u201d\n  - *Analysis:* The opposition highlights that many professors may lack the communication skills or desire to advocate publicly, referencing surveys indicating hesitancy due to potential backlash. This argument is logically valid and supported by specific evidence.\n\n- **Effectiveness of Rebuttals:**\n  - The opposition effectively counters the proposition by emphasizing the practical limitations and potential inefficiencies of expecting all professors to engage in advocacy.\n  - The proposition\u2019s rebuttal suggests institutional support for willing professors but does not sufficiently address the broad applicability of advocacy roles.\n\n- **Clash Decision:** **Opposition Wins**  \n  *Justification:* The opposition successfully points out that expecting all professors to engage in public advocacy may not be feasible, leading to ineffective or uneven contributions to policy changes. This practical limitation undermines the proposition's argument for widespread advocacy.\n\n**I.2 Argument Hierarchy and Impact**\n\n- **Proposition\u2019s Core Arguments:**\n  1. **Enrichment of Academic Community:** Public advocacy by professors leads to informed discussions and heightened public interest in academic research.\n  2. **Social Responsibility and Accountability:** Professors have an ethical obligation to engage with the public to inform policy and promote social justice.\n  3. **Policy Influence and Societal Progress:** Advocacy can drive meaningful policy changes and address pressing social issues.\n\n- **Opposition\u2019s Core Arguments:**\n  1. **Compromised Objectivity and Integrity:** Public advocacy may lead to biases and undermine the credibility of academic research.\n  2. **Lack of Diversity in Viewpoints:** Mandatory advocacy can result in self-censorship and homogenization of thought within academia.\n  3. **Professor Capability and Interest:** Not all professors possess the necessary skills or inclination to engage effectively in public advocacy.\n\n- **Impact Assessment:**\n  - The opposition's arguments regarding objectivity and diversity are more central to the core values of academia and thus have a more significant impact on the overall debate outcome.\n  - The proposition\u2019s arguments, while important, are somewhat contingent on the opposition's stronger claims about the risks of advocacy.\n\n- **Relative Importance:**  \n  The arguments concerning academic integrity and diversity of viewpoints hold greater weight in determining the debate's outcome, making the opposition's case more impactful.\n\n**I.3 Consistency and Contradictions**\n\n- **Proposition:** Maintains a consistent stance favoring the benefits of public advocacy without contradicting its initial claims.\n- **Opposition:** Consistently highlights the risks associated with mandatory advocacy, without internal contradictions.\n- **Dropped Arguments:** Both sides adequately address their initial claims without neglecting significant points.\n\n**II. Evaluation Requirements**\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Both sides presented their strongest possible arguments, with the opposition particularly fortifying their stance through credible evidence.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** The judgment is based solely on the provided debate text, adhering to the rules.\n- **Ignore Presentation:** The analysis focuses exclusively on argument substance, disregarding rhetorical elements.\n- **Framework Neutrality:** The evaluation remains neutral, assessing each side within their respective frameworks.\n\n**III. Common Judging Errors to AVOID**\n\n- **Intervention:** No external arguments or evidence were introduced.\n- **Shifting the Burden of Proof:** Both sides were held to the same standard in supporting their claims.\n- **Over-reliance on \"Real-World\" Arguments:** Balanced evaluation of principled and practical arguments was maintained.\n- **Ignoring Dropped Arguments:** All presented arguments were addressed.\n- **Double-Counting:** Each argument was evaluated once.\n- **Assuming Causation from Correlation:** Assumptions about causation were critically examined.\n\n**IV. Decision Making**\n\n- **Winner:** Opposition\n- **Confidence Level:** 80\n- **Explanation:**\n  - The opposition secured victory in two out of three major clashes, specifically those concerning the preservation of academic integrity and the maintenance of diverse viewpoints within academia.\n  - These clashes were pivotal as they directly challenged the foundational principles of academic freedom and the core functioning of the academic community.\n  - The opposition's arguments were well-supported by credible evidence and logically sound, effectively outweighing the proposition's assertions.\n\n- **Key Factors:**\n  1. **Preservation of Academic Integrity:** The opposition successfully argued that public advocacy could compromise objectivity, a cornerstone of academic work.\n  2. **Maintenance of Diverse Viewpoints:** Demonstrating that mandatory advocacy could lead to homogenization of thought was crucial in upholding the value of diverse perspectives in academia.\n  3. **Practical Limitations:** Highlighting that not all professors are equipped or inclined towards advocacy emphasized the impracticality of the proposition's demands.\n\n- **Detailed Reasoning:**\n  The opposition's success in the key clashes related to academic integrity and diversity of viewpoints fundamentally undermined the proposition's case for mandatory public advocacy. By presenting specific evidence and logical arguments that these aspects of academia could be adversely affected, the opposition established a more compelling and impactful position. Additionally, by addressing the practical limitations of expecting all professors to engage in advocacy, the opposition reinforced the feasibility concerns surrounding the proposition's stance. These combined factors led to a clear and justified decision in favor of the opposition.\n\n**V. Line-by-Line Justification**\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** Addressed the enrichment of academia through advocacy, promotion of social responsibility, and the potential for policy impact.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** Focused on the risks to objectivity and academic integrity, the threat to diversity of viewpoints, and the impracticality of expecting all professors to engage in advocacy.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** Challenged the opposition's claims about compromised objectivity and lack of diversity, arguing for the benefits of advocacy and institutional support.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** Countered the proposition by reinforcing concerns about objectivity, diversity, and professor capabilities, while advocating for selective support rather than mandatory advocacy.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** Emphasized key clashes favoring the proposition, including academic enrichment, diversity enhancement through advocacy, and institutional support for skilled advocates.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** Reinforced the opposition's stance by addressing core concerns and demonstrating how public advocacy can coexist with academic integrity and diversity when properly supported.\n\n**VI.

Direct Clash Resolution\n\n#### **Clash 1: Academic Integrity vs. Advocacy**\n- **Proposition's Claim:**  \n  - \"Professors engaging in public advocacy enrich the academic community and foster informed discussions.\"  \n  - Support: A study by AAUP showing public engagement increases public interest and understanding.  \n  - Specific examples: Noam Chomsky and Cornel West influencing public opinion.\n\n- **Opposition's Counterclaim:**  \n  - \"Professors should not be obligated to engage in public advocacy as it can compromise their objectivity and academic integrity.\"  \n  - Support: Political advocacy aligns scholars with biases, reducing neutral pursuit of knowledge.\n\n- **Proposition's Rebuttal:**  \n  - Merely engaging in public discourse does not inherently bias research; rather, engagement integrates academics into essential societal debates.  \n  - Some fields (e.g., climate science) are inherently political, and avoiding advocacy is itself a political act.  \n  - Academic freedom should *include* the freedom to advocate based on research.\n\n- **Opposition's Rebuttal:**  \n  - Raising public engagement may pressure scholars to conform to dominant political opinions instead of neutrally producing knowledge.  \n  - Bias perception weakens trust in academic research.  \n  - If advocacy is \"expected,\" it could restrict academic freedom rather than enhance it.\n\n**Winner:** **Opposition.**  \n- **Justification:** The opposition identifies a key flaw in the proposition\u2019s argument\u2014if professors are publicly associated with advocacy, their credibility as neutral researchers diminishes. While the proposition argues that addressing social issues is essential, they do not sufficiently address how trust in research is preserved amid advocacy. The opposition further strengthens their case by showing how institutional expectations of advocacy could harm academic freedom by inducing conformity. The proposition\u2019s rebuttal is weaker because it assumes that advocacy does not perceptibly impact public trust, which remains contested.\n\n---\n\n#### **Clash 2: Advocacy Stifling or Expanding Diverse Views**\n- **Proposition's Claim:**  \n  - \"Engagement in public advocacy promotes social responsibility and accountability among scholars.\"  \n  - Support: Academic freedom gives professors a duty to contribute knowledge to the public sphere.\n\n- **Opposition's Counterclaim:**  \n  - \"Forcing professors to engage in public advocacy can lead to a lack of diversity in viewpoints and perspectives within academia.\"  \n  - Support: Evidence from AAUP shows political pressures can induce self-censorship, limiting intellectual diversity.\n\n- **Proposition's Rebuttal:**  \n  - Public engagement initiatives actually increase speech diversity by encouraging dialogue.  \n  - More academics engaging with the public ensures a variety of perspectives are represented.\n\n- **Opposition's Rebuttal:**  \n  - If professors witness backlash against certain views, they may self-censor rather than voice unpopular but valuable perspectives.  \n  - Encouraging *partisan* public engagement promotes ideological homogeneity rather than increasing true diversity.\n\n**Winner:** **Opposition.**  \n- **Justification:** While the proposition argues that advocacy provides a platform for more diverse voices, the opposition presents stronger evidence (academic surveys) that professors experience pressure *against* expressing dissenting views. The proposition assumes that *all* academic engagement leads to diverse viewpoints, but the opposition shows that pressure to conform to dominant viewpoints can paradoxically reduce intellectual diversity. This is a fundamentally stronger observation about human behavior under pressure.\n\n---\n\n#### **Clash 3: Not All Academics Should Be Advocates**\n- **Proposition's Claim:**  \n  - \"Public advocacy by professors can lead to meaningful policy changes and societal progress.\"  \n  - Support: Examples like climate scientists influencing environmental policies and the Paris Agreement.\n\n- **Opposition's Counterclaim:**  \n  - \"Expecting professors to engage in advocacy overlooks the reality that not all academics are equipped for public engagement.\"  \n  - Support: Many professors lack public communication skills or interest in advocacy, yet they are highly effective as researchers.\n\n- **Proposition\u2019s Rebuttal:**  \n  - Institutions should provide training and resources to support those who wish to engage.  \n  - An expectation to participate doesn\u2019t mean everyone *must*\u2014academic roles evolve to match societal needs.\n\n- **Opposition\u2019s Rebuttal:**  \n  - Efforts to train professors for advocacy do not change the fact that forcing some into public roles detracts from their research and teaching effectiveness.  \n  - Policies encouraging advocacy may create indirect pressure on reluctant academics to conform.\n\n**Winner:** **Opposition.**  \n- **Justification:** The opposition\u2019s argument highlights an often-overlooked aspect: some professors are highly skilled in research but unsuited for public discourse. While the proposition suggests training programs could mitigate this issue, they fail to address why all professors *should* take on advocacy roles when their core expertise lies in scholarly research. The opposition\u2019s principle\u2014that academia should allow scholars to focus on research without external advocacy pressures\u2014is more persuasive.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n- **Most Central Argument:** The debate's crux lies in whether public advocacy disrupts academic integrity and trust.\n- **Relative Importance of Arguments:**\n  1. **Academic Integrity vs. Advocacy Bias** (Strongest Clash) \u2013 Addresses fundamental academic trust.\n  2. **Diversity of Viewpoints** \u2013 Determines whether public engagement enhances or stifles discourse.\n  3. **Not All Academics Should Be Advocates** \u2013 Practical concern, less essential than the ethical concerns above.\n\nOpposition wins the two most critical clashes, outweighing the proposition\u2019s best arguments.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Consistency and Dropped Arguments\n\n- **Proposition Drops:** Insufficient response to the claim that public engagement expectations create pressures that reduce intellectual diversity.\n- **Opposition Drops:** Minimal\u2014strong rebuttals throughout.\n\n---\n\n## II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning:** Applied\u2014arguments were considered in strongest form.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** Decision relies solely on debate content.\n- **Ignoring Presentation:** Judgment based purely on logic and evidence.\n- **Framework Neutrality:** No bias toward either team.\n\n---\n\n## III. Common Judging Errors to Avoid\n\n- **No intervention:** Decision based only on debate text.\n- **No burden shifting:** Both sides had equal proof burden.\n- **No real-world bias:** Abstract and practical arguments weighed fairly.\n- **Correct handling of dropped arguments:** Noted and assessed.\n\n---\n\n## IV. Decision Making\n\n### Winner: **Opposition**\n**Confidence: 85 (Clear Victory)**\n\n### **Key Decisive Factors:**\n1. **Academic Integrity Clash:** The opposition\u2019s argument that advocacy invites bias and undermines credibility is not sufficiently rebutted.\n2. **Diversity Clash:** The opposition provides stronger evidence that advocacy pressures encourage ideological conformity rather than truly diversifying viewpoints.\n3. **Professors\u2019 Suitability Clash:** The opposition convincingly argues that while advocacy benefits some professors, imposing this expectation harms those better suited to research.\n\nThe proposition had strong points about societal impact but did not fully address trust, credibility, and self-censorship concerns raised by the opposition.\n\n---\n\n## V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n- **Proposition Opening Speech:** Provides structured argumentation and calls on real-world examples like Chomsky/West but does not preemptively address credibility issues.\n- **Opposition Opening Speech:** Establishes a strong principled foundation around academic freedom, credibility, and diversity\u2014points that structure the entire opposition case.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** Attempts to counter academic bias concerns but does not engage in refuting *perceptions* of bias, which is a key flaw.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** Well-structured rebuttals clarifying academic neutrality, diversity concerns, and limitations of advocacy.\n- **Proposition Closing Speech:** Tries to reframe the debate as a discussion on responsibility, missing the strongest opposition points.\n- **Opposition Closing Speech:** Effectively synthesizes earlier points, reinforcing how advocacy pressure harms integrity and academic diversity.\n\n---\n\n**Final Verdict:**\n<winnerName>opposition</winnerName>  \n<confidence>85</confidence>"

      "logic": "### I. Core Judging Principles\n\n#### 1. Direct Clash Resolution\n\n**Clash 1: Does public advocacy by professors enrich the academic community, or does it compromise academic integrity?**\n\n- **Proposition's Claim:** \"Professors engaging in public advocacy enrich the academic community and foster informed discussions.\"\n- **Proposition's Evidence:** A study by the American Association of University Professors found that professors\u2019 engagement in public discourse increases public interest in research and enhances societal understanding. They cite Noam Chomsky and Cornel West as examples of scholars who have influenced public thought.\n- **Opposition's Rebuttal:** Advocacy can compromise academic integrity by pressuring professors to align their work with political ideologies, undermining trust in scholarly research.\n- **Proposition's Counter-Rebuttal:** Advocacy does not inherently threaten objectivity. Many fields, such as climate science and public health, are inherently tied to social and political issues. Academic freedom includes the right to engage in public debate, which can encourage open critique rather than erode integrity.\n- **Opposition's Final Argument:** Proposition does not prove that engagement necessarily prevents bias. Taking a public stance can still undermine objectivity, making research appear partisan.\n\n**Resolution:** The Opposition wins this clash. Although the Proposition argues that public advocacy is part of academic freedom, their response does not sufficiently address how engaging in advocacy might introduce bias into academic work. The burden was on them to prove that advocacy does not pose a risk to objectivity, and their argument that some disciplines are inherently political does not negate this risk.\n\n---\n\n**Clash 2: Does public advocacy lead to a greater diversity of viewpoints, or does it create self-censorship in academia?**\n\n- **Proposition's Claim:** \"Engagement in public advocacy promotes social responsibility and accountability among scholars.\"\n- **Opposition's Rebuttal:** Pressure to conform to dominant political ideologies can lead to self-censorship. A survey by the American Association of University Professors shows that many scholars hesitate to express controversial opinions for fear of backlash.\n- **Proposition's Counter-Rebuttal:** Universities that support public engagement initiatives actually enhance viewpoint diversity by providing platforms for different scholars to contribute.\n- **Final Opposition Response:** Universities may promote engagement, but the real-world effect remains: When professors face social and political backlash, they are less likely to express unpopular opinions.\n\n**Resolution:** Opposition wins this clash. Proposition\u2019s evidence that universities promote engagement does not concretely prove that this leads to genuine diversity of thought. The Opposition provides a more direct causal link between pressures to publicly advocate and self-censorship.\n\n---\n\n**Clash 3: Should all professors be expected to engage in advocacy, or is this an unrealistic burden?**\n\n- **Opposition's Claim:** \"Many professors are not suited for public advocacy and should not be pressured into it.\"\n- **Opposition's Evidence:** Some scholars lack the communication skills or the interest required for effective advocacy. Expecting all professors to participate risks diverting them from their primary duties of teaching and research.\n- **Proposition\u2019s Rebuttal:** Professors willing to engage should be supported through training and institutional support. Public engagement is an evolving expectation of academia.\n- **Opposition\u2019s Final Response:** This still does not justify an expectation for all professors. Some will always be unsuited, and institutional support cannot change this.\n\n**Resolution:** Opposition wins this clash. Proposition fails to refute that mandatory advocacy would place undue pressure on scholars who prefer to focus on research.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact\n\n- **Opposition\u2019s argument about academic integrity was the most essential to the debate.** If public engagement inherently risks bias, then all subsequent benefits suggested by the Proposition are diminished. \n- **The argument about viewpoint diversity had significant implications.** If advocacy leads to self-censorship, this actively harms academic discourse.\n- **The argument about individual ability affects practical implementation.** If some professors cannot effectively engage, the central motion that professors \u201cshould\u201d engage becomes more difficult to support.\n\nOpposition\u2019s key arguments were all interconnected and reinforced each other, while Proposition\u2019s arguments each faced strong rebuttals.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Consistency and Contradictions\n\n- **Proposition\u2019s contradiction:** They argue that public engagement fosters viewpoint diversity, yet they also argue that many disciplines inherently interact with political issues. If some topics are already politicized, this raises the question of whether engagement truly broadens perspectives or simply pushes existing political narratives.\n- **Opposition\u2019s consistency:** They maintain that expectation of advocacy risks bias, conformity, and misalignment of expertise, reinforcing a single thematic objection.\n\nThe lack of internal contradiction strengthens the Opposition\u2019s case.\n\n---\n\n### II. Evaluation Requirements\n\n- **Steelmanning Applied:** Both teams\u2019 arguments were considered in their strongest form.\n- **Argument-Based Decision:** No external knowledge was used.\n- **Ignoring Presentation & Framework Neutrality:** This was judged based on argument strength rather than style.\n\n---\n\n### III. Common Judging Errors Avoided\n\n- No intervention (judged only based on what was stated).\n- No burden-shifting.\n- No assumptions of correlation = causation.\n- No ignoring dropped arguments.\n\n---\n\n### IV. Decision Making\n\n**Winner:** Opposition  \n**Confidence Level:** 85 (clear victory but not overwhelming)  \n\n**Key Factors for Decision:**\n1. **Academic Integrity Argument:** Opposition provided stronger reasoning and evidence proving that political advocacy could compromise objectivity.\n2. **Viewpoint Diversity Clash:** Opposition showed that pressures for advocacy could stifle dissenting opinions.\n3. **Ability & Expectations Clash:** Proposition failed to address that not all academics are suited for public advocacy.\n\nProposition did make some reasonable arguments, but their responses to the core concerns were weaker than the Opposition\u2019s rebuttals.\n\n---\n\n### V. Line-by-Line Justification\n\n- **Proposition Opening:** Strong claims about engagement enriching academia, but reliance on broad case studies rather than clear causality between advocacy and academic benefits.\n- **Opposition Opening:** Identifies clear risks of bias, self-censorship, and undue pressure, supported by concrete survey data.\n- **Proposition Rebuttal:** Attempts to counter bias concerns but does not dismantle them; argues for institutional support without proving effectiveness.\n- **Opposition Rebuttal:** Reinforces core risks and successfully dismantles Proposition\u2019s strongest claims by highlighting real-world constraints.\n- **Proposition Closing:** Frames advocacy as enhancing objectivity but cannot refute that bias risks remain.\n- **Opposition Closing:** Successfully integrates all key clashes into a cohesive rejection of the motion, reinforcing each key argument.\n\n---\n\n### Final Formatting Output\n```xml\n<winnerName>opposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>85</confidence>\n```"

Direct Clash Resolution**\n\n##### **Clash 1: Academic Integrity and Objectivity**\n- **Proposition's Claim**:  \n  *\"Professors engaging in public advocacy enrich the academic community and foster informed discussions.\u201d*  \n  - Supported by evidence from the *American Association of University Professors*, claiming that public professor engagement increases academic research awareness and educates the public.\n\n- **Opposition's Response**:  \n  *\"Professors should not be obligated to engage in public advocacy as it can compromise their objectivity and academic integrity.\"*  \n  - Based on the principle of academic freedom and the argument that public stances could undermine scholarly credibility and lead to bias.\n\n- **Proposition's Rebuttal**:  \n  - Argues that engagement in fields like climate science necessitates public discourse. Professors can distinguish between academic research and personal opinions while maintaining objectivity.\n\n- **Opposition's Counter-Rebuttal**:  \n  - Argues that engagement inherently risks alignment with political agendas, affecting public trust in research.\n\n- **Clash Evolution & Decision**:  \n  - The crux of the dispute is whether public engagement inherently leads to bias. Proposition argues that expertise-driven advocacy *informs* public discourse rather than distorting it, but fails to rebut how public perception of bias could damage trust. Opposition maintains that professors\u2019 credibility could be undermined, leading to research dismissal.  \n  - **Opposition wins this clash** because the risk of perceived bias is real and weakens academic credibility, a concern not sufficiently refuted by the Proposition.\n\n---\n\n##### **Clash 2: Diversity of Perspectives in Academia**\n- **Proposition's Claim**:  \n  *\"Engagement in public advocacy promotes social responsibility and accountability among scholars.\u201d*  \n  - Argues that academic freedom empowers public expression and professors have a duty to share expertise.\n\n- **Opposition's Response**:  \n  *\"Forcing professors into advocacy can reduce diversity of viewpoints.\"*  \n  - Cites self-censorship studies where pressure to conform discourages expressing controversial ideas.\n\n- **Proposition\u2019s Rebuttal**:  \n  - Cites university public engagement programs increasing discourse diversity rather than suppressing it.\n\n- **Opposition's Counter-Rebuttal**:  \n  - Claims a systematic expectation still risks silencing dissenting voices.\n\n- **Clash Evolution & Decision**:  \n  - The debate boils down to whether public advocacy fosters or limits diverse viewpoints. Proposition provides counterexamples demonstrating that engagement provides a more nuanced debate. Opposition contends that environments with strong advocacy cultures can create ideological echo chambers.  \n  - **Proposition wins this clash** because their evidence demonstrates universities effectively engaging diverse perspectives, a claim the Opposition does not discredit with stronger contrary evidence.\n\n---\n\n##### **Clash 3: Not All Professors Are Suited for Public Advocacy**\n- **Opposition's Claim**:  \n  *\"Expecting professors to engage in public advocacy overlooks the reality that not all academics are equipped or interested in being public figures.\"*  \n  - Supported by evidence that some professors lack communication skills and are uncomfortable in advocacy roles.\n\n- **Proposition's Response**:  \n  - Agrees that not all professors are naturally inclined but contends that institutions should provide training and support for those who are.\n\n- **Opposition's Counter-Rebuttal**:  \n  - This expectation risks taking time and focus away from core research and teaching duties.\n\n- **Clash Evolution & Decision**:  \n  - Opposition argues that requiring engagement imposes an undue burden. Proposition argues for institutional adaptation but does not fully address the stress such an expectation could cause.  \n  - **Opposition wins this clash** because their argument highlights how a mandatory advocacy expectation may harm academic focus.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Argument Hierarchy and Impact**\n1. **Most Crucial Clash**: **Academic Integrity & Objectivity**  \n   - If advocacy indeed compromises objectivity, then professors\u2019 trustworthiness in the public sphere diminishes\u2014a critical weakness for the proposition's stance.\n2. **Second Most Crucial**: **Diversity of Perspectives**  \n   - If advocacy encourages viewpoint diversity, it strengthens academia\u2019s role in discourse. Conversely, if it suppresses dissent, it weakens the public engagement argument.\n3. **Least Crucial**: **Not All Professors Suited**  \n   - This argument affects feasibility rather than the ethics or impact of public advocacy.\n\nThe **Opposition's victory in Clashes 1 and 3 outweighs the Proposition's single win in Clash 2**, highlighting more critical risks in academic settings.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Consistency and Contradictions**\n- **Proposition Contradiction**: Advocates for voluntary engagement but also presents it as a duty.  \n- **Opposition Consistency**: Maintains that advocacy can be valuable but must be a choice.\n\n---\n\n### **II. Evaluation Requirements**\n- **Steelmanning**: Both sides were considered in their strongest light.\n- **Argument-Based Decision**: My judgment is based *only* on the debate\u2019s content.\n- **Ignoring Presentation**: Delivery style was disregarded.\n- **Framework Neutrality**: Both academic integrity and public engagement values were neutrally assessed.\n\n---\n\n### **III. Common Judging Errors to Avoid**\n- **No Bias Towards Practical Arguments**: Evaluated all claims on strength.\n- **No Unfair Burden Shifting**: Both sides had equal proof burdens.\n- **No Unjustified Clash Decisions**: Every decision was explained.\n\n---\n\n### **IV. Decision Making**\n- **Winner**: **Opposition**\n- **Confidence Level**: **75**\n  - **Decisive win in Academic Integrity** (Crucial impact).\n  - **Win in Suitability Argument** (Reinforcing practical concerns).\n  - **Loss in Diversity Argument**, but this was less decisive.\n\n---\n\n### **V. Line-by-Line Justification**\n1. **Proposition Opening Speech** establishes strong benefits of public engagement but assumes that advocacy enhances academia rather than compromising credibility.  \n2. **Opposition Opening Speech** presents principled concerns regarding bias, self-censorship, and suitability, setting up strong vulnerabilities in the proposition\u2019s case.  \n3. **Proposition Rebuttal** effectively counters the diversity argument but does not sufficiently dismantle bias concerns.  \n4. **Opposition Rebuttal** reinforces the objectivity argument, successfully defending its case against proposition critiques.  \n5. **Proposition Closing Speech** presents a strong defense of diversity but inadequately mitigates the academic bias critique.  \n6. **Opposition Closing Speech** prioritizes academic objectivity and practical concerns, solidifying its victory by refocusing on integrity-based concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final XML Output:**\n```xml\n<winnerName>opposition</winnerName>\n<confidence>75</confidence>\n```"
